If you’d like to revisit the overall project structure and framework design, check out the companion post: Plant Star Brawl - Framework Design.\nDevelopment Workflow - Gameplay Layer Main Menu and Character Selection Screens\nChallenge 1: Where should the main camera be placed, given that the project uses a camera class? Solution: Pass the camera as a parameter to rendering functions. Challenge 2: How can we give text a 3D or embossed effect? Solution: Render the text twice—once in white at the original position, and once in gray slightly offset downward and to the right. Challenge 3: How can we create a scrolling silhouette effect on the selection screen background Solution: Draw the same image twice with offset positions to simulate motion. In-Game Scene Setup and Physics Simulation\nChallenge 1: How do we simulate gravity? Solution: Gravity is represented by falling and stopping. Encapsulate platform logic in a dedicated class. Challenge 2: How can we visually inspect collision data? Solution: Implement a simple debug mode to visualize hitboxes and physics boundaries. Issue 1: Why does the player sometimes teleport upward during a fall? Solution: Use the player’s foot position from the previous frame to determine whether to correct their position in the current frame. Issue 2: How do we prevent repeated jumping (multi-jump bugs)? Solution: Ensure the player can only jump when their vertical velocity is zero. Bullet Base Class Implementation\nCore Gameplay Mechanic: Players deal damage using projectile-like bullets. Solution: Create a base Bullet class, with specific bullet types inheriting from it. Challenge: How should bullets disappear after collision? Solution: Use callback functions, similar to how death animations are handled for players.

There are three possible approaches:\nOption 1: Define the camera as a member variable inside each scene class. However, this makes it difficult to share camera data across scenes.\nOption 2: Define the camera as a global variable, similar to how image resources are handled. We could use the extern keyword to access it. But global variables tend to clutter the design and conflict with our goal of encapsulating data and minimizing global state.\nOption 3: Take inspiration from how delta (elapsed time) is passed into update functions like void on_update(int delta). We apply the same idea to rendering: pass the camera as a parameter using void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera).\nImplementing the Main Menu Scene Once the camera handling strategy is decided, here’s the full implementation of the main menu scene:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 extern IMAGE img_menu_background; extern SceneManager scene_manager; class MenuScene : public Scene { public: MenuScene() = default; ~MenuScene() = default; // Override necessary virtual functions from the base Scene class void on_enter() { mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play bgm_menu repeat from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); } void on_update(int delta) { } void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) { putimage(0, 0, \u0026amp;img_menu_background); } void on_input(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) { if (msg.message == WM_KEYUP) { mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play ui_confirm from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); scene_manager.switch_to(SceneManager::SceneType::Selector); } } void on_exit() { } private: }; Implementing the Selector Scene Character Type Design Tip We start by defining an enumeration for the available player character types. Why include an “Invalid” character type? It acts as a safeguard to ensure that selection logic doesn’t go out of bounds. This helps prevent bugs when navigating the character list and makes the system more robust.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 enum class PlayerType { Peashooter = 0, Sunflower, Invalid }; Example: Switching Player 1’s Character to the Left\nTo implement leftward character selection for Player 1, we follow a safe and bounded approach using the PlayerType enumeration:\nConvert the current enum value to an int and subtract 1 This moves the selection one step to the left. Add the int value of PlayerType::Invalid This ensures the result is non-negative, even if the original value was 0. Take the result modulo PlayerType::Invalid This wraps the value around if it goes below the first valid type, keeping it within bounds. Cast the final result back to PlayerType This gives us a valid enum value within the range [Peashooter, Invalid)—a half-open interval that excludes the Invalid sentinel. This technique guarantees that the selected character type always stays within the valid range, and avoids out-of-bounds errors when navigating the character list.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 case WM_KEYUP: switch (msg.vkcode) { case 0x41: // \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; is_btn_1P_left_down = false; player_type_1 = (PlayerType)(((int)PlayerType::Invalid + (int)player_type_1 - 1) % (int)PlayerType::Invalid); mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play ui_switch from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); break; // ...... } Integrating the Camera into the Animation Class Since every animation needs to access the camera’s position during rendering, and this logic is repeated across all animation draws, we apply object-oriented encapsulation to streamline it.\nInstead of calculating world position - camera position externally, we move this logic into the Animation class itself. As a result, the on_draw method is updated to: void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera, int x, int y) const . This allows each animation to handle its own coordinate transformation internally, keeping rendering logic clean and consistent.\nImplementing the Scrolling Silhouette Background Effect A simple way to create a scrolling background is to render the same image twice. Imagine a vertical reference line moving from the left edge of the screen to the right. When it reaches the far edge, it jumps back to the start.\nWe draw one copy of the image to the left of the line, and another to the right. This creates a seamless scrolling loop.\nUpdate Logic:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 void on_update(int delta) { animation_peashooter.on_update(delta); animation_sunflower.on_update(delta); // Scroll background horizontally selector_background_scroll_offset_x += 5; if (selector_background_scroll_offset_x \u0026gt;= img_peashooter_selector_background_left.getwidth()) { selector_background_scroll_offset_x = 0; } } To render cropped sections of an image with alpha blending, we overload putimage_alpha:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 inline void putimage_alpha(int dst_x, int dst_y, int width, int height, IMAGE* img, int src_x, int src_y) { int w = width \u0026gt; 0 ? width : img-\u0026gt;getwidth(); int h = height \u0026gt; 0 ? height : img-\u0026gt;getheight(); AlphaBlend(GetImageHDC(GetWorkingImage()), dst_x, dst_y, w, h, GetImageHDC(img), src_x, src_y, w, h, { AC_SRC_OVER, 0 , 255, AC_SRC_ALPHA }); } We scroll Player 2’s silhouette across Player 1’s background, and vice versa:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) { IMAGE* img_P1_selector_background = nullptr; IMAGE* img_P2_selector_background = nullptr; // Assign scrolling backgrounds based on opponent\u0026#39;s character switch (player_type_2) { case PlayerType::Peashooter: img_P1_selector_background = \u0026amp;img_peashooter_selector_background_right; break; case PlayerType::Sunflower: img_P1_selector_background = \u0026amp;img_sunflower_selector_background_right; break; default: img_P1_selector_background = \u0026amp;img_peashooter_selector_background_right; break; } switch (player_type_1) { case PlayerType::Peashooter: img_P2_selector_background = \u0026amp;img_peashooter_selector_background_left; break; case PlayerType::Sunflower: img_P2_selector_background = \u0026amp;img_sunflower_selector_background_left; break; default: img_P2_selector_background = \u0026amp;img_peashooter_selector_background_left; break; } putimage(0, 0, \u0026amp;img_selector_background); // Draw static background\t// Draw dynamic scrolling silhouettes putimage_alpha(getwidth() - selector_background_scroll_offset_x, 0, img_P2_selector_background); putimage_alpha(getwidth() - img_P2_selector_background-\u0026gt;getwidth(), 0, img_P2_selector_background-\u0026gt;getwidth() - selector_background_scroll_offset_x, 0, img_P2_selector_background, selector_background_scroll_offset_x, 0); putimage_alpha(selector_background_scroll_offset_x - img_P1_selector_background-\u0026gt;getwidth(), 0, img_P1_selector_background); putimage_alpha(selector_background_scroll_offset_x, 0, img_P1_selector_background-\u0026gt;getwidth() - selector_background_scroll_offset_x, 0, img_P1_selector_background, 0, 0); putimage_alpha(pos_img_VS.x, pos_img_VS.y, \u0026amp;img_VS); // Draw \u0026#34;VS\u0026#34; graphic // ...... } Physics Engine Implementation Platform Class Design We start by designing the platform collider based on its functional role. In most 2D platformer games, platforms are typically one-way colliders—players can land on them from above, but jump through them from below. This means we only need to determine where the player can “stand,” so we abstract the platform collider as a single horizontal line.\nIt’s important to note that while the platform’s position is stored in the collider structure, we still need to separately track its rendering position. This is because the platform image has thickness, and its top edge may not align with the collision line. Typically, the collision line is slightly above the visible top of the platform image, which better matches player expectations visually.\nThis design also aligns with our broader architectural principle of separating data logic from rendering. During collision detection, we only care about the CollisionShape data. During rendering, we only care about the image and its draw position. This reinforces decoupling and keeps the code clean.\nTo support debugging, we add a simple debug mode that draws the collision line when enabled. Here’s the full implementation of the Platform class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 extern bool is_debug; class Platform { public: struct CollisionShape // Describes the collider shape { float y; float x_left; float x_right; }; public: CollisionShape shape; // Decoupled logic and rendering IMAGE* img = nullptr; POINT render_position = { 0 }; public: Platform() = default; ~Platform() = default; void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) const { putimage_alpha(camera, render_position.x, render_position.y, img); // Draw collision line if debug mode is enabled if (is_debug) { setlinecolor(RGB(255, 0, 0)); line(camera, (int)shape.x_left, (int)shape.y, (int)shape.x_right, (int)shape.y); } } private: }; Player Base Class Design All shared data and logic for players are encapsulated in a base Player class. Specific characters like Peashooter and Sunflower inherit from this base and implement their own behavior.\nHow are player objects instantiated?\nSince there are two player types, the actual class to instantiate depends on the character selected during the character selection phase. This logic belongs in the selector scene, but the instantiated player objects are also needed in the gameplay scene. The simplest solution is to define them globally, just like other cross-scene resources.\nHere’s how the instantiation logic looks in the selector scene:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 // SelectorScene.h class SelectorScene : public Scene { public: // ...... void on_exit() { // Instantiate player objects based on selected character types switch (player_type_1) { case PlayerType::Peashooter: player_1 = new PeashooterPlayer(); break; case PlayerType::Sunflower: player_1 = new SunflowerPlayer(); break; } switch (player_type_2) { case PlayerType::Peashooter: player_2 = new PeashooterPlayer(); break; case PlayerType::Sunflower: player_2 = new SunflowerPlayer(); break; } } // ...... } In addition, each player needs to store their position in world coordinates using Vector2 position;. Animation definitions should also be included, with each subclass specifying which atlas to use for rendering.\nHandling player input and mapping key events to gameplay logic should be implemented in the base class. To differentiate controls between Player 1 and Player 2, we assign a player index as a member variable. This allows input handling logic to branch based on the player’s identity.\nOne-Way Platform Collision and Gravity Simulation Gravity Simulation In a free-fall scenario, two key values govern motion: gravitational acceleration and the object’s current velocity. Throughout the simulation, objects in the scene are constantly pulled downward by gravity, accelerating vertically over time.\nTo model this, we define a gravity constant in the Player class: const float gravity = 1.6e-3f;\t. This value may seem arbitrary, but in game development, gravity is often tuned to suit the game world’s scale, visual proportions, and player feel. It doesn’t need to match real-world physics—it just needs to produce the right gameplay effect.\nAll physics-related logic is placed in the move_and_collide(int delta) method. Gravity simulation itself only requires two lines:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Player.h // ...... protected: void move_and_collide(int delta) { velocity.y += gravity * delta; position += velocity * (float)delta; } // ...... One-Way Platform Collision Detection To detect collisions between the player and platforms, we check for horizontal overlap between a rectangle (the player) and a line (the platform). Specifically:\nCalculate the difference between the rightmost and leftmost edges of both shapes. If this difference is less than the sum of their widths, they overlap horizontally. Vertical collision is simpler: check whether the platform’s Y-coordinate lies between the player’s top and bottom edges. Only when both horizontal and vertical conditions are met do we consider a collision.\nPosition Correction Logic\nOnce a collision is detected, we need to adjust the player’s position so they land on the platform. However, naïvely snapping the player’s feet to the platform can cause visual glitches—especially when the player jumps upward and only partially intersects the platform before falling.\nTo fix this, we ensure that the player’s entire body has passed through the platform before snapping them onto it. We calculate the player’s foot position from the previous frame and only apply correction if it was above the platform.\nHere’s the refined collision logic:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 void move_and_collide(int delta) { velocity.y += gravity * delta; position += velocity * (float)delta; // Collision detection if (velocity.y \u0026gt; 0) { for (const Platform\u0026amp; platform : platform_list) { const Platform::CollisionShape\u0026amp; shape = platform.shape; bool is_collide_x = (max(position.x + size.x, shape.x_right) - min(position.x, shape.x_left) \u0026lt;= size.x + (shape.x_right - shape.x_left)); bool is_collide_y = (shape.y \u0026gt;= position.y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; shape.y \u0026lt;= position.y + size.y); if (is_collide_x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is_collide_y) { // Check previous frame’s foot position to avoid snapping mid-jump float delta_pos_y = velocity.y * delta; float last_tick_foot_pos_y = position.y + size.y - delta_pos_y; if (last_tick_foot_pos_y \u0026lt;= shape.y) { position.y = shape.y - size.y; velocity.y = 0; break; } } } } } Character Skill System Functional Requirements This project features two playable characters: Peashooter and Sunflower. Each has a basic attack and a special skill.\nPeashooter: Fires pea bullets in the direction they’re facing. Hitting the opponent builds energy. Once full, Peashooter unleashes a rapid burst of pea bullets as a special attack. Sunflower: Throws sun bombs diagonally upward. These projectiles are affected by gravity, making them harder to aim but more rewarding. When energy is full, Sunflower summons a giant sun bomb above the opponent’s head, dealing massive area damage and granting high energy returns. From a design perspective, both characters rely on projectile-based combat. This allows us to unify all projectile logic under a single base class: Bullet.\nEach projectile type—pea bullet, sun bomb, super sun bomb—can inherit from Bullet and implement its own update and rendering logic. Differences like animation, damage radius, and behavior are handled in the subclasses.\nBullet Deactivation and Removal Logic Just like how we handle player death animations in the Animation class, bullets should be marked as invalid immediately upon hitting an enemy. This prevents them from colliding multiple times in subsequent frames. However, since we want to play destruction animations—like the pea bullet shattering or the sun bomb exploding—we can’t remove the bullet object from the scene right away.\nInstead, each bullet goes through three distinct states:\nActive: The bullet is moving and checking for collisions. Inactive: The bullet has collided and is playing its destruction animation. Collision checks are disabled. Removable: The animation has finished, and the bullet can now be deleted from the scene. This state logic is reflected in the bullet’s member variables:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 // Bullet.h protected: Vector2 size;\t// Bullet collider size Vector2 position;\t// Bullet position Vector2 velocity;\t// Bullet velocity int damage = 10;\t// Damage value bool valid = true;\t// Whether the bullet is still active bool can_remove = false;\t// Whether the bullet can be deleted function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback;\t// Collision callback PlayerID target_id = PlayerID::P1;\t// Target player ID Optimizing Bullet Removal If bullets are only removed upon collision, those that miss will remain in memory indefinitely—leading to memory leaks. To prevent this, we also check whether a bullet has moved off-screen. This logic is common to all bullet types, so we define a helper method in the base class:\n1 2 3 4 5 bool check_if_exceeds_screen() { return (position.x + size.x \u0026lt;= 0 || position.x \u0026gt;= getwidth() || position.y + size.y \u0026lt;= 0 || position.y \u0026gt;= getheight()); } Full Bullet Base Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 extern bool is_debug; // Bullet Base Class class Bullet { public: Bullet() = default; ~Bullet() = default; virtual void on_collide() { if (callback) callback(); } virtual bool check_collision(const Vector2\u0026amp; position, const Vector2\u0026amp; size) { // Check if bullet center is inside the target\u0026#39;s bounding box return this-\u0026gt;position.x + this-\u0026gt;size.x / 2 \u0026gt;= position.x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this-\u0026gt;position.x + this-\u0026gt;size.x / 2 \u0026lt;= position.x + size.x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this-\u0026gt;position.y + this-\u0026gt;size.y / 2 \u0026gt;= position.y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this-\u0026gt;position.y + this-\u0026gt;size.y / 2 \u0026lt;= position.y + size.y; } virtual void on_update(int delta) { } virtual void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) const { if (is_debug) { setfillcolor(RGB(255, 255, 255)); setlinecolor(RGB(255, 255, 255)); rectangle((int)position.x, (int)position.y, (int)(position.x + size.x), (int)(position.y + size.y)); solidcircle((int)(position.x + size.x / 2), (int)(position.y + size.y / 2), 5); } } // Setters and getters void set_damage(int val) { damage = val; } int get_damage() { return damage; } void set_position(float x, float y) { position.x = x; position.y = y; } const Vector2\u0026amp; get_position() const { return position; } const Vector2\u0026amp; get_size() const { return size; } void set_velocity(float x, float y) { velocity.x = x; velocity.y = y; } void set_collide_target(PlayerID target) { target_id = target; } PlayerID get_collide_target() const { return target_id; } void set_callback(function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback) { this-\u0026gt;callback = callback; } void set_valid(bool flag) { valid = flag; } bool get_valid() const { return valid; } bool check_can_remove() const { return can_remove; } protected: bool check_if_exceeds_screen() { return (position.x + size.x \u0026lt;= 0 || position.x \u0026gt;= getwidth() || position.y + size.y \u0026lt;= 0 || position.y \u0026gt;= getheight()); } protected: Vector2 size;\tVector2 position; Vector2 velocity; int damage = 10;\tbool valid = true;\tbool can_remove = false;\tfunction\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback;\tPlayerID target_id = PlayerID::P1;\t}; Note:\nIn practice, it\u0026rsquo;s rare to design a game object class completely top-down from the start. Class design is often an iterative process—built and refined as the project evolves. We typically start with a rough structure and improve it through trial, error, and usage. Top-down design requires experience and foresight, but with continued practice, you\u0026rsquo;ll become more comfortable and confident in applying this approach.\nPea Bullet Class Design The Peashooter character fires only one type of bullet. The difference between normal and special attacks lies in the firing rate. To make the game feel more dynamic, we use three different sound effects and randomly play one when a pea bullet hits its target. This technique is common in game development—for example, footsteps or gunshots often use varied audio clips to make the experience feel more natural and lively.\nTo implement this, we override the on_collide method in the PeaBullet subclass and add randomized sound playback. Importantly, when overriding a method but still needing to execute the base class logic, we must explicitly call the parent method.\nHere’s the complete implementation of the PeaBullet subclass:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 // PeaBullet.h extern IMAGE img_pea; extern Atlas atlas_pea_break; class PeaBullet : public Bullet { public: PeaBullet() { size.x = 64, size.y = 64;\t// Set bullet size damage = 10; animation_break.set_atlas(\u0026amp;atlas_pea_break); animation_break.set_interval(100); animation_break.set_loop(false); animation_break.set_callback([\u0026amp;]() { can_remove = true; }); } ~PeaBullet() = default; void on_update(int delta) { position += velocity * (float)delta;\t// Move bullet if (!valid) animation_break.on_update(delta);\t// Play destruction animation if (check_if_exceeds_screen()) can_remove = true; } void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) const { if (valid) putimage_alpha(camera, (int)position.x, (int)position.y, \u0026amp;img_pea); else animation_break.on_draw(camera, (int)position.x, (int)position.y); Bullet::on_draw(camera); } void on_collide() { Bullet::on_collide();\t// Call base class logic switch (rand() % 3) { case 0: mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play pea_break_1 from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); break; case 1: mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play pea_break_2 from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); break; case 3: mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play pea_break_3 from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); break; } } private: Animation animation_break;\t// Destruction animation }; Building on the Bullet base class, the PeaBullet subclass only needs to extend a few unique behaviors to deliver a complete projectile implementation. This elegantly demonstrates the power of inheritance in object-oriented design: shared logic lives in the base class, while specialized behavior is layered on top with minimal duplication. It’s a clean, maintainable approach that scales well as new projectile types are introduced.\nSun Bullet Class Implementation One important detail when implementing the sun bomb is that its explosion animation frames are slightly larger than its idle animation frames. To ensure the explosion renders correctly, we need to align the centers of both animation rectangles. Since EasyX uses the top-left corner as the origin for rendering, we apply a small positional offset during the explosion animation to visually center it.\nUnlike the pea bullet, which continues flying after impact to simulate a splash effect, the sun bomb should remain stationary once it explodes. It’s affected by gravity while active, but its explosion animation plays in place.\nHere’s the full implementation of the SunBullet class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 // SunBullet.h extern Atlas atlas_sun; extern Atlas atlas_sun_explode; extern Camera main_camera; class SunBullet : public Bullet { public: SunBullet() { size.x = 96, size.y = 96; damage = 20; animation_idle.set_atlas(\u0026amp;atlas_sun); animation_idle.set_interval(50); animation_explode.set_atlas(\u0026amp;atlas_sun_explode); animation_explode.set_interval(50); animation_explode.set_loop(false); animation_explode.set_callback([\u0026amp;]() { can_remove = true; }); // Calculate offset to center explosion animation IMAGE* frame_idle = animation_idle.get_frame(); IMAGE* frame_explode = animation_explode.get_frame(); explode_render_offset.x = (frame_idle-\u0026gt;getwidth() - frame_explode-\u0026gt;getwidth()) / 2.0f; explode_render_offset.y = (frame_idle-\u0026gt;getheight() - frame_explode-\u0026gt;getheight()) / 2.0f; } ~SunBullet() = default; void on_update(int delta) { if (valid) { velocity.y += gravity * delta; position += velocity * (float)delta; } if (!valid) animation_explode.on_update(delta); else animation_idle.on_update(delta); if (check_if_exceeds_screen()) can_remove = true; } void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) const { if (valid) animation_idle.on_draw(camera, (int)position.x, (int)position.y); else { animation_explode.on_draw(camera, (int)(position.x + explode_render_offset.x), (int)(position.y + explode_render_offset.y)); } Bullet::on_draw(camera); } void on_collide() { Bullet::on_collide(); main_camera.shake(5, 250);\t// Camera shake effect mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play sun_explode from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); } private: const float gravity = 1e-3f;\tprivate: Animation animation_idle;\tAnimation animation_explode;\tVector2 explode_render_offset;\t}; Sun Bullet Ex Class Implementation Sunflower’s special skill summons a massive sun bomb from off-screen. Unlike the standard sun bomb, this projectile is larger, stronger, and unaffected by gravity. It descends slowly, acting as a zoning tool to restrict enemy movement and make smaller bombs easier to land.\nTo give it a broader hitbox, we override the check_collision method to use rectangle-based collision detection instead of a single center point.\nHere’s the full implementation of the SunBulletEx class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 // SunBulletEx.h extern Atlas atlas_sun_ex; extern Atlas atlas_sun_ex_explode; extern Camera main_camera; class SunBulletEx : public Bullet { public: SunBulletEx() { size.x = 288, size.y = 288; damage = 20; animation_idle.set_atlas(\u0026amp;atlas_sun_ex); animation_idle.set_interval(50); animation_explode.set_atlas(\u0026amp;atlas_sun_ex_explode); animation_explode.set_interval(50); animation_explode.set_loop(false); animation_explode.set_callback([\u0026amp;]() { can_remove = true; }); // Calculate offset to center explosion animation IMAGE* frame_idle = animation_idle.get_frame(); IMAGE* frame_explode = animation_explode.get_frame(); explode_render_offset.x = (frame_idle-\u0026gt;getwidth() - frame_explode-\u0026gt;getwidth()) / 2.0f; explode_render_offset.y = (frame_idle-\u0026gt;getheight() - frame_explode-\u0026gt;getheight()) / 2.0f; } ~SunBulletEx() = default; void on_update(int delta) { if (valid) { position += velocity * (float)delta; } if (!valid) animation_explode.on_update(delta); else animation_idle.on_update(delta); if (check_if_exceeds_screen()) can_remove = true; } void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) const { if (valid) animation_idle.on_draw(camera, (int)position.x, (int)position.y); else { animation_explode.on_draw(camera, (int)(position.x + explode_render_offset.x), (int)(position.y + explode_render_offset.y)); } Bullet::on_draw(camera); } void on_collide() { Bullet::on_collide(); main_camera.shake(20, 350);\tmciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play sun_explode_ex from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL); } bool check_collision(const Vector2\u0026amp; position, const Vector2\u0026amp; size) { bool is_collide_x = (max(this-\u0026gt;position.x + this-\u0026gt;size.x, position.x + size.x) - min(this-\u0026gt;position.x, position.x) \u0026lt;= this-\u0026gt;size.x + size.x); bool is_collide_y = (max(this-\u0026gt;position.y + this-\u0026gt;size.y, position.y + size.y) - min(this-\u0026gt;position.y, position.y) \u0026lt;= this-\u0026gt;size.y + size.y); return is_collide_x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is_collide_y; } private: Animation animation_idle; Animation animation_explode; Vector2 explode_render_offset; }; From a design perspective, the super sun bomb could inherit from the standard sun bomb to reduce duplication. However, this project opts for a flatter inheritance structure to keep the codebase easier to read and maintain.\nSkill System To implement character skills, we define two virtual methods in the Player base class: virtual void on_attack and virtual void on_attack_ex. Each player subclass overrides these methods to implement its own normal and special attack logic. This keeps the skill system extensible and cleanly separated across character types.\nAttack Cooldown Implementation Most characters in action games have a cooldown period between normal attacks. During this time, pressing the attack key has no effect. To implement this, we define a boolean flag can_attack to indicate whether the character is currently allowed to perform a normal attack. We also use a timer to track the cooldown duration, represented by an int value in milliseconds.\nThe logic is simple:\nWhen an attack input is received, check if can_attack is true. If so, flip the flag to false and start the cooldown timer. Once the timer completes, reset can_attack to true. This ensures that attacks can only be triggered after the cooldown period has passed.\nInvulnerability State Implementation To implement temporary invincibility (often triggered after taking damage), we use two boolean flags:\nbool is_invulnerable = false; — indicates whether the character is currently invincible. bool is_showing_sketch_frame = false; — controls whether the character should render as a white silhouette for visual feedback. We use two timers to manage the invulnerability logic:\ntimer_invulnerable — controls the duration of invincibility. timer_invulnerable_blink — toggles between normal and sketch-frame rendering to create a blinking effect. Here’s how these timers are initialized in the Player constructor:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 // Player.h Player() { current_animation = is_facing_right; // Initialize attack cooldown timer timer_attack_cd.set_wait_time(attack_cd); timer_attack_cd.set_one_shot(true); timer_attack_cd.set_callback([\u0026amp;]() { can_attack = true; }); // Initialize invulnerability timer timer_invulnerable.set_wait_time(750); timer_invulnerable.set_one_shot(true); timer_invulnerable.set_callback([\u0026amp;]() { is_invulnerable = false; is_showing_sketch_frame = false; // Ensure sketch frame is disabled when invulnerability ends }); }); // Initialize blink timer for invulnerability animation timer_invulnerable_blink.set_wait_time(75); timer_invulnerable_blink.set_callback([\u0026amp;]() { is_showing_sketch_frame = !is_showing_sketch_frame; }); // ...... } To render the character as a white silhouette during invulnerability, we add a utility function in Util.h. This function processes the image’s pixel buffer and sets all pixels to white. For a detailed explanation, refer to the bonus section of the article Teyvat Survivors.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // Util.h inline void sketch_image(IMAGE* src, IMAGE* dst) { int w = src-\u0026gt;getwidth(); int h = src-\u0026gt;getheight(); Resize(dst, w, h); DWORD* src_buffer = GetImageBuffer(src); DWORD* dst_buffer = GetImageBuffer(dst); for (int y = 0; y \u0026lt; h; y++) { for (int x = 0; x \u0026lt; w; x++) { int idx = y * w + x; dst_buffer[idx] = BGR(RGB(255, 255, 255)) | (src_buffer[idx] \u0026amp; 0xFF000000); } } } In the on_update method, we update all timers accordingly.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // Player.h virtual void on_update(int delta) { // ...... // Whether to render the sketch (silhouette) image // Only generate the sketch frame when the player is invulnerable and blinking if (is_showing_sketch_frame) sketch_image(current_animation-\u0026gt;get_frame(), \u0026amp;img_sketch); // ...... } We apply the sketch rendering logic inside the on_draw method:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // Player.h virtual void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) { // ...... if (hp \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is_invulnerable \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is_showing_sketch_frame) putimage_alpha(camera, (int)position.x, (int)position.y, \u0026amp;img_sketch); else current_animation-\u0026gt;on_draw(camera, (int)position.x, (int)position.y); // ...... } To activate invulnerability after taking damage, we add a dedicated method to the Player class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 // Player.h void make_invulnerable() { is_invulnerable = true; timer_invulnerable.restart(); is_showing_sketch_frame = true; // Immediately enter sketch frame mode timer_invulnerable_blink.restart(); // Start blinking effect } Then, inside the move_and_collide method, we update the bullet collision logic to trigger invulnerability when the player is hit:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 // Player.h void move_and_collide(int delta) { // ...... if(!is_invulnerable) { for (Bullet* bullet : bullet_list) { if (!bullet-\u0026gt;get_valid() || bullet-\u0026gt;get_collide_target() != id) continue; if (bullet-\u0026gt;check_collision(position, size)) { make_invulnerable();\t// Activate invulnerability bullet-\u0026gt;on_collide(); bullet-\u0026gt;set_valid(false); hp -= bullet-\u0026gt;get_damage(); // ...... } } // ...... }\tParticle System Implementation A particle system is a technique that uses large numbers of small graphical elements (particles) to simulate complex visual effects like smoke, fire, rain, or explosions. When designing a particle system, we typically break it down into two components:\nParticle objects: Represent individual particles, each with properties like animation, physics, and lifespan. Particle emitters: Control how particles are generated—frequency, direction, initial velocity, etc. In this project, we implement a lightweight particle system. Each particle behaves like a specialized animated object. Unlike characters or bullets, particles remain fixed in world space once emitted. After their animation finishes, they expire and are removed from the scene.\nHere’s the complete Particle class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 class Particle { public: Particle() = default; Particle(const Vector2\u0026amp; position, Atlas* atlas, int lifespan) : position(position), atlas(atlas), lifespan(lifespan) { } ~Particle() = default; void on_update(int delta) { timer += delta; if (timer \u0026gt;= lifespan) { timer = 0; idx_frame++; if (idx_frame \u0026gt;= atlas-\u0026gt;get_size()) { idx_frame = atlas-\u0026gt;get_size() - 1; valid = false; } } } void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera) const { putimage_alpha(camera, (int)position.x, (int)position.y, atlas-\u0026gt;get_image(idx_frame)); } void set_atlas(Atlas* new_atlas) { atlas = new_atlas; } void set_position(const Vector2\u0026amp; new_position) { position = new_position; } void set_lifespan(int ms) { lifespan = ms; } bool check_valid() const { return valid; } private: int timer = 0;\t// Frame timer int lifespan = 0;\t// Duration per frame in milliseconds int idx_frame = 0;\t// Current animation frame index Vector2 position;\t// World-space position bool valid = true;\t// Whether the particle is still active Atlas* atlas = nullptr;\t// Animation atlas }; Overall Code Review and Source Code Scene Base Class This project introduces the concept of scene management for the first time. Each stage or interface in the game corresponds to a distinct scene. In the base class Scene.h, the on_enter and on_exit methods handle scene initialization and teardown respectively. The on_input, on_update, and on_draw methods correspond to the input, update, and rendering phases of the main loop, each receiving the necessary parameters. Subclasses only need to override these methods to implement their own logic.\nThe scene manager controls which scene is currently active. When switching scenes, we use an enum to abstract away direct scene pointers. The manager itself also exposes on_input, on_update, and on_draw methods that delegate to the current scene instance.\nMain Function In main.cpp, we implement two core responsibilities: resource loading and game entry point. First, we load pixel fonts and animation assets, including mirrored versions for directional rendering. Then we load background music and sound effects. In the entry function, we initialize resources, instantiate the initial scene, and invoke the scene manager’s lifecycle methods within the main game loop.\nAtlas Class For animation handling, we encapsulate an Atlas class that acts as a container for loading and storing image sequences. The Animation class is a lightweight manager that tracks playback progress. It doesn’t store image data directly—instead, it queries the atlas for the current frame. The animation class also handles frame intervals, looping, and end-of-playback callbacks.\nCamera Class Rendering uses a custom Camera class that serves as an anchor for relative positioning. By randomly jittering the camera’s position within a small range, we simulate a screen shake effect. To simplify camera-based rendering, we overload utility functions in Util.h for alpha blending, image flipping, and generating white silhouette effects.\nTimer and Vector2 Classes Two foundational utility classes support the framework: Timer and Vector2. The Timer class tracks elapsed time and triggers callbacks when a preset duration is reached. The Vector2 class handles 2D vector math, including overloaded arithmetic operators, length calculation, and normalization.\nScene Subclasses: MenuScene, SelectorScene, GameScene The game starts in the menu scene, which simply plays music and handles scene transitions. The character selection scene uses hardcoded layout logic to render UI elements, dynamically draws character previews based on player choices, and handles input for both players using separate key mappings. Upon exiting the selection scene, we instantiate the chosen characters and assign their avatars and player IDs, which are defined in PlayerID.h.\nThe in-game scene handles three main areas:\nWorld elements like background and platforms Player-related elements like characters and bullets Game state elements like health tracking and victory conditions Debug mode toggling is also managed within the game scene.\nPlayer Base Class The Player base class encapsulates shared logic for all characters. Visually, players have animations for idle, running, attacking, and dying, along with particle effects for jumping, landing, and running. Logically, normal and special attacks are controlled via cooldown timers and energy values. Movement actions like jumping and landing are wrapped in dedicated methods for easy triggering and animation updates.\nDamage triggers a brief invulnerability period with a blinking visual effect, managed by timers. Physics simulation is handled in the move_and_collide method, which updates position based on gravity and velocity, and performs collision checks with platforms and bullets.\nPeashooter and Sunflower Subclasses With the base class in place, implementing the Peashooter is straightforward—just configure its animations and define bullet spawning logic. We also use randomized sound effects to enhance feedback.\nSunflower follows a similar pattern, but its special attack includes an extra “sun” animation above the character’s head, requiring a custom rendering override.\nBullet Base Class Bullets are abstracted via the Bullet base class. Like players, bullets move through the scene and may be affected by gravity. We track velocity and update position accordingly. Bullets also store damage values, target IDs, and collision callbacks.\nPeaBullet, SunBullet, and SunBulletEx Subclasses The PeaBullet subclass overrides the collision method to play randomized sound effects and switches rendering logic based on whether the bullet has shattered. The SunBullet simulates gravity until impact, then plays an explosion animation with center alignment adjustments. The SunBulletEx is larger and stronger, descending at a constant speed rather than accelerating under gravity.\nParticle Class Particles are treated as lightweight animated objects. Once their animation finishes, they expire and are removed from the scene. Their update logic closely resembles that of the Animation class.\nPlatform Class Platforms are represented as horizontal lines in world space. For rendering, we use image assets and optionally draw debug overlays depending on the debug mode.\nStatusBar Class Each player’s status bar consists of three components: avatar, health bar, and energy bar. During gameplay, we continuously read these values from the player object and render them in the UI.\nWith that, this project’s notes are complete.\nFull Source Code on GitHub\nReflection and Summary This was my first time studying how a complete game project is designed from the top down. At the beginning, the framework felt abstract and hard to grasp—especially without something like the gameplay layer to test things frequently and intuitively. I often felt unsure of whether I was on the right track. But once the foundational structure was in place, building out the gameplay layer became a smooth and satisfying process. Everything started to click into place.\nEven with the experience I gained from the previous Teyvat Survivor project, this one was filled with intricate implementation details. A single oversight could easily lead to unexpected bugs. Some of the design ideas would have been difficult—or even impossible—for me to come up with on my own without falling into common pitfalls. Thankfully, the instructor’s explanations were clear, and the code was clean and easy to follow, which made the learning process much more approachable.\nThis project made me realize once again where I currently stand in my programming journey: just when I feel like I’ve understood something, I discover how much more there is that I don’t know. And that’s okay. It’s a reminder to keep sharpening my skills and stay committed to continuous learning.\n","date":"2025-10-12T09:17:30+02:00","image":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/c-game-dev-from-scratchplant-star-brawl-gameplay-layer/cover_hu_99b3491f26bc8327.webp","permalink":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/c-game-dev-from-scratchplant-star-brawl-gameplay-layer/","title":"【C++ Game Dev from Scratch】Plant Star Brawl - Gameplay Layer"},{"content":"Table of Contents\nOverview Core Gameplay Design Approach Development Workflow – Framework Key Steps and Solutions – Framework This project spans over 2,000 lines of code and covers a wide range of concepts, so I’ve split the write-up into two parts. This first post provides an overview of the entire project, with a focus on the design and implementation of the framework-related components.\nOverview Tech Stack: C++ + EasyX\nProject Goal: The project is organized using multiple header files, with a modular structure that introduces the concept of “scenes” to separate different stages of gameplay and decouple core functionalities. It explores basic physics simulation techniques and implements one-way collision platforms. Popular game development features like the camera, timer, and particle system are encapsulated to enhance the project’s level of polish and professionalism. Additionally, smoother animations and richer sound effects are integrated to improve the overall completeness of the game.\nCourse Source：Bilibili-Voidmatrix\nCore Gameplay Two players can choose different characters for local multiplayer battles. They jump and move between platforms, using a variety of normal and special attacks to damage their opponent and earn energy rewards. Once enough energy is accumulated, players can unleash unique skills. A player is defeated either by falling off the platform or when their health reaches zero.\nDesign Approach Using Multiple Header Files As the project grows in size, keeping all the code in main.cpp quickly becomes unwieldy. It leads to messy namespaces and tangled dependencies, making debugging and maintenance difficult. To manage complexity, this project organizes code by encapsulating different game stages into separate classes, each placed in its own header file.\nCommon Pitfall – Duplicate Includes：\nWhen we use #include to bring in a header file, the compiler performs a literal copy-paste of that file’s contents at the include location. For example, if A.h includes B.h, and main.cpp includes both A.h and B.h, then B.h ends up being included twice. If B.h contains class definitions or other declarations, this can lead to duplicate definitions and compilation errors.\nHow to Avoid This：\nUse the preprocessor directive #pragma once: This tells the compiler to include the contents of a header file only once, no matter how many times it\u0026rsquo;s referenced.\nAlternatively, use include guards with #ifndef: This checks whether a macro (usually based on the filename) has already been defined. If not, it defines the macro and includes the file; otherwise, it skips it.\nExample syntax:\n1 2 3 4 #ifndef _SCENE_H_ #define _SCENE_H_ #endlif // !_SCENE_H_ Both methods are widely used and generally interchangeable in most cases.\nDifferences Between the Two Approaches：\nFeature #ifndef / #define #pragma once Compatibility Supported by all standard C/C++ compilers Supported by most modern compilers, but not standardized Mechanism Uses macro definitions to check for duplicates Compiler internally tracks whether the file has been processed Filename Dependency Independent of file name; relies on macro name Depends on file path; may be affected by hard or symbolic links Conflict Risk Macro names must be unique; naming conflicts may cause issues No naming required; avoids conflicts Compilation Speed Slightly slower (macro parsing required) Faster (direct skip on repeat includes) Designing the Game Framework Creating the window, setting up the main game loop, and stabilizing the frame rate—this structure is essentially a standard pattern in game development frameworks:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 int main() { //========= Initialize data ========== initgraph(1280, 720); bool is_running = true; const int FPS = 60; ExMessage msg; BeginBatchDraw(); while (is_running)\t// Main game loop { DWORD start_time = GetTickCount(); //========= Handle input ========= while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { }\t//======== Handle update ========= cleardevice(); //======== Handle rendering ========= FlushBatchDraw(); //========= Stabilize frame rate ========= DWORD end_time = GetTickCount(); DWORD delta_time = end_time - start_time; if (delta_time \u0026lt; 1000 / FPS) { Sleep(1000 / FPS - delta_time); } } EndBatchDraw(); return 0; } Object/Class Design This project introduces architectural concepts by analyzing core functionalities and designing a well-structured program layout. The goal is to improve scalability and make debugging during development more manageable.\nScene Base Class Menu Scene Class Selector Scene Class Game Scene Class Scene Manager Class Atlas Class Animation Class Vector2 Class Camera Class Timer Class Platform Class Player Base Class Peashooter Class Sunflower Class Player ID Enumeration Class Bullet Base Class Pea Bullet Class Sun Bullet Class Sun Bullet Ex Class Status Bar Class Particle Class Development Workflow - Framework Game Framework Design Scene System Architecture Solution: Use inheritance, with each game stage implemented as a subclass of the base Scene class, allowing for more flexible scene management. Challenge: How to switch between scenes? Solution: Introduce a Scene Manager to handle transitions. Resource Loading Challenge 1： How to manage animations efficiently and enable resource reuse? Solution: Implement Atlas and Animation classes. Challenge 2: How to trigger death animations when an enemy is defeated? Solution: Use callback functions to handle animation logic. Improving Visual Flexibility Solution: Implement a Camera class to control the viewport. Challenge 1: How to track camera position more precisely? Solution: Avoid using EasyX’s built-in POINT class (which uses integers); instead, create a custom Vector2 class with floating-point coordinates. Challenge 2: How to express impact effects visually? Solution: Add camera shake effects for hit feedback. Timer Usage Across Gameplay Challenge: Beyond animations and camera shake, many features (e.g. special skills, attack cooldowns) require timing control. Solution: Encapsulate a reusable Timer class to provide unified management for time-sensitive features. Key Steps and Solutions - Framework Scene System Design If we think of a scene as a stage in a play, then each scene has its own “script” logic and a unique cast of characters. These characters are what game developers commonly refer to as GameObjects—players, enemies, bullets, items, and so on. Conceptually, they all fall under the GameObject category, each performing different logic under the direction of the scene’s script.\nFrom a programming perspective, a game can be divided into several stages: the main menu, the character selection screen, and the in-game scene. Based on this, we define a base Scene class. The main menu, character selection, and gameplay scenes can each inherit from this base class to implement their own event handling and rendering logic.\nScene Base Class All member functions are defined as virtual, allowing each specific scene class to override them with its own logic. The Scene base class serves as a template for all concrete scene subclasses.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 class Scene { public: Scene() = default; ~Scene() = default; virtual void on_enter() {}; // Enter the scene virtual void on_update(int delta) {};\t// Handle updates virtual void on_draw() {};\t// Handle rendering virtual void on_input(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) {};\t// Handle player input virtual void on_exit() {}; // Exit the scene private: }; MenuScene Class (Main Menu Scene) You can override the necessary member functions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 class MenuScene : public Scene { public: MenuScene() = default; ~MenuScene() = default; // Override required virtual functions from the base Scene class void on_enter() { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Entered Main Menu\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; } void on_update(int delta) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Main Menu is running......\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; } void on_draw() { outtxtxy(10, 10, _T(\u0026#34;Drawing Main Menu content\u0026#34;))； } void on_input(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) { // Handle input if needed } void on_exit() { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Exiting Main Menu\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; } private: }; Instantiating in main.cpp\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 int main() { initgraph(1280, 720, EW_SHOWCONSOLE);\t// Keep the console window visible BeginBatchDraw(); Scene* scene = new MenuScene();\t// Instantiate before entering the main loop while (running) { DWORD frame_start_time = GetTickCount(); while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { scene-\u0026gt;on_input(msg); // Handle input } // Update game logic scene-\u0026gt;on_update(); cleardevice(); // Render game screen scene-\u0026gt;on_draw(); FlushBatchDraw(); DWORD frame_end_time = GetTickCount(); DWORD frame_delta_time = frame_end_time - frame_start_time; if (frame_delta_time \u0026lt; 1000 / FPS) { Sleep(1000 / FPS - frame_delta_time); } } EndBatchDraw(); return 0; } All scene subclasses follow the same design pattern.\nImplementing the Scene Manager A game program is essentially a massive loop—and also a massive state machine. Each game scene represents a distinct state, and the system that manages these states is commonly referred to in game development as the Scene Manager.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 class SceneManager { public: enum class SceneType\t// Marks the current scene state { Menu, Game, Selector }; public: SceneManager() = default; ~SceneManager() = default; // Set the current scene void set_current_scene(Scene* scene) { current_scene = scene; current_scene-\u0026gt;on_enter();\t// Ensure the scene lifecycle is properly triggered } // Switch scenes (exit the current scene, then select and enter the new one) void switch_to(SceneType type) { current_scene-\u0026gt;on_exit();\t// Exit the current scene switch (type) { case SceneType::Menu: current_scene = menu_scene; break; case SceneType::Game: current_scene = game_scene; break; case SceneType::Selector: current_scene = selector_scene; break; default: break; } current_scene-\u0026gt;on_enter();\t// Enter the newly selected scene } void on_update(int delta) { current_scene-\u0026gt;on_update(delta); } void on_draw() { current_scene-\u0026gt;on_draw(); } void on_input(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) { current_scene-\u0026gt;on_input(msg); } private: Scene* current_scene = nullptr; }; The on_enter and on_exit methods serve similar purposes to constructors and destructors—they’re used to initialize and release resources. So why not just use constructors and destructors directly?\nThe reason is that constructors and destructors control the memory lifecycle of scene objects. If we rely on them to handle all enter/exit logic, we’d need to constantly create and destroy scene objects during transitions, which is not performance-friendly. As game logic grows more complex, some resources may be shared across scenes. In other words, objects within a scene may need to outlive the scene itself, which introduces additional memory management challenges.\nThis design offers a cleaner and more flexible approach: scene objects live as long as the game itself. All scenes are created during game initialization and destroyed when the game exits. During runtime, we avoid calling constructors and destructors for scene transitions, and instead use clearly defined on_enter and on_exit methods. These methods should avoid creating or destroying internal members—instead, they reset internal state.\nExample: Suppose the game scene contains a player object. When the player’s health reaches zero, the game transitions to the main menu. If we use constructors/destructors, we’d need to delete the game scene and new the menu scene. Then, when returning to the game scene, we’d have to recreate everything just to reset the player’s health.\nWith on_enter and on_exit, we avoid this overhead. Instead, we simply reset the player’s health variable when re-entering the game scene—achieving the same “fresh start” effect without costly object reconstruction.\nWhy use a pointer for setting the current scene, but an enum for switching scenes?\nThis design choice reflects usage context:\nset_current_scene is typically called during game initialization, when scenes are being instantiated—so passing a pointer is straightforward. switch_to is usually called during runtime from within scene logic. If scenes hold references to each other, passing pointers directly can lead to memory issues. Using an enum abstracts away internal pointer management and keeps transitions safe and clean. With this setup, the scene-related logic in main can be fully delegated to the Scene Manager:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 menu_scene = new MenuScene(); game_scene = new GameScene(); selector_scene = new SelectorScene(); scene_manager.set_current_scene(menu_scene); BeginBatchDraw(); while (running) { DWORD frame_start_time = GetTickCount(); while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { scene_manager.on_input(msg); } scene_manager.on_update(); cleardevice(); scene_manager.on_draw(main_camera); FlushBatchDraw(); Scene transitions are handled within each scene’s on_input method.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // MenuScene.h void on_input(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) { if (msg.message == WM_KEYUP) { scene_manager.switch_to(SceneManager::SceneType::Selector); } } Resource Loading Design Implementing the Atlas Class The Atlas class serves as a container for a series of related image resources:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 class Atlas { public: Atlas() = default; ~Atlas() = default; void load_from_file(LPCTSTR path_template, int num) { // Important: Clear the image list before loading // and resize it to the expected number of frames. // This prevents mismatches when load_from_file is called multiple times. img_list.clear();\timg_list.resize(num); TCHAR path_file[256]; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; num; i++) { _stprintf_s(path_file, path_template, i + 1); loadimage(\u0026amp;img_list[i], path_file); } } void clear()\t// Clear all loaded images in the atlas { img_list.clear(); } size_t get_size()\t// Get the number of images in the atlas { return img_list.size(); } IMAGE* get_image(int idx)\t// Retrieve a specific animation frame { if (idx \u0026lt; 0 || idx \u0026gt;= img_list.size()) return nullptr; return \u0026amp;img_list[idx];\t// Return the address of the image at the given index } // Add an existing image to the atlas // This may seem redundant with file loading, // but it\u0026#39;s useful for generating horizontally flipped atlases void add_image(const IMAGE\u0026amp; img)\t{ img_list.push_back(img); } private: vector\u0026lt;IMAGE\u0026gt; img_list; }; Resource Loading Strategy Before implementing the Animation class, we need a way to horizontally flip animation frames. This avoids the need for duplicate assets. Since pixel-level flipping is computationally expensive, it should be done during game initialization, not during frame updates.\nThis flipping function is a utility and should be placed in util.h for easy access across the project. A detailed explanation is available in another post: Teyvat Survivor.\nIn main.cpp, we define flip_atlas as a global function so it can be called before the main loop:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 // main.cpp void flip_atlas(Atlas\u0026amp; src, Atlas\u0026amp; dst) { dst.clear(); // Prevent issues from reusing the same container for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; src.get_size(); i++) { IMAGE img_flipped; flip_image(src.get_image(i), \u0026amp;img_flipped); dst.add_image(img_flipped); } } For now, all resources are loaded via a global function in main.cpp. It’s important to use meaningful and consistent naming for assets. A recommended format is type_character_direction, such as Atlas atlas_peashooter_idle_left;. While verbose, this naming convention improves editor searchability and debugging efficiency.\nThe resource loading logic includes three parts:\nLoading game fonts Loading and processing image assets Loading sound effects Sound effects are handled using mciSendString, so don’t forget to include the appropriate library.\nImplementing the Animation Class The Animation class acts as a lightweight controller for rendering atlases. It builds on top of the Atlas class and is designed around two components:\nMember variables: define the data structure Member functions: provide external interfaces for querying and modifying state Since frame progression is automatic during playback, there’s no need for external set methods. Instead, only get_idx_frame and get_frame are exposed for frame access.\nThe two most important methods—on_update and on_draw—are explained in detail in the Teyvat Survivor article.\nHow should we handle disappearing animations for objects like enemies or bullets when their lifecycle ends?\nWe shouldn’t delete the Enemy object immediately upon death. Instead, we delay deletion until the death animation finishes. This requires the animation system to signal when playback is complete.\nA common solution: use callback functions.\nCallback Functions A callback is a function object passed as a parameter and stored for later execution. This allows logic to be triggered at the “right moment.”\nFor example, when an enemy dies, we define the deletion logic as a function and store it in the animation object. Once the death animation finishes, the callback is invoked to remove the enemy.\nBe sure to write #include \u0026lt;functional\u0026gt; at the top. Here’s a sample implementation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 class Animation { public: ...... void on_update(int delta) { timer += delta; if (timer \u0026gt; interval) { timer = 0; idx_frame++; if (idx_frame \u0026gt;= atlas-\u0026gt;get_size()) { idx_frame = is_loop ? 0 : atlas-\u0026gt;get_size() - 1; if (!is_loop \u0026amp;\u0026amp; callback) // If animation is non-looping and callback exists, invoke it { callback(); } } } } void set_callback(function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback) { this-\u0026gt;callback = callback; } private: ...... function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback; // Callback to trigger object removal after animation finishes }; Here’s the full implementation of the Animation class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 class Animation { public: Animation() = default; ~Animation() = default; void reset() { timer = 0; idx_frame = 0; } void set_atlas(Atlas* new_atlas) { reset(); atlas = new_atlas; } void set_loop(bool flag) { is_loop = flag; } void set_interval(int ms) { interval = ms; } int get_idx_frame() { return idx_frame; } IMAGE* get_frame() { return atlas-\u0026gt;get_image(idx_frame); } bool check_finished() { if (is_loop) return false; return (idx_frame == atlas-\u0026gt;get_size() - 1); } void on_update(int delta) { timer += delta; if (timer \u0026gt; interval) { timer = 0; idx_frame++; if (idx_frame \u0026gt;= atlas-\u0026gt;get_size()) { idx_frame = is_loop ? 0 : atlas-\u0026gt;get_size() - 1; if (!is_loop \u0026amp;\u0026amp; callback) // If animation is non-looping and callback exists, invoke it { callback(); } } } } void on_draw(const Camera\u0026amp; camera, int x, int y) const { putimage_alpha(camera, x, y, atlas-\u0026gt;get_image(idx_frame)); } void set_callback(function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback) { this-\u0026gt;callback = callback; } private: Atlas* atlas = nullptr; bool is_loop = true; // Whether the animation loops int timer = 0;\t// Frame timer int interval = 0;\t// Frame interval in milliseconds int idx_frame = 0;\t// Current frame index function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback; // Callback to trigger object removal after animation finishes }; Camera System Design Window Coordinates vs. World Coordinates In EasyX, the origin of the window coordinate system is at the top-left corner of the screen:\nEasyX Window Coordinates In contrast, the world coordinate system represents a much larger virtual space. Think of it as the entire game world where all objects—players, enemies, bullets, items—are placed and interact. Player movement, collisions, triggers, and all game logic operate within this world space. Only when rendering the game do we need to convert world coordinates into window coordinates.\nThe camera acts as a bridge between these two systems. This aligns with the game development principle of separating data from rendering.\nWhen we ignore zooming (i.e., the camera’s width and height match the window’s), we can treat the camera as a single point in the world. In a side-scrolling game, for example, the camera simply follows the player’s position. To render other objects, we subtract the camera’s world position from each object’s world position to get their window coordinates.\nKey concept:\nWindow Coordinate = World Coordinate - Camera Coordinate\nImplementing the Vector2 Class To allow precise control of the camera’s position using floating-point values, we define a commonly used 2D vector class. Operator overloading makes it easier to perform arithmetic operations similar to built-in types:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 class Vector2 { public: Vector2() = default; ~Vector2() = default; Vector2(float x, float y) // Constructor for direct initialization : x(x),y(y){ } //======== Operator Overloads ======== // Enables intuitive vector arithmetic Vector2 operator+(const Vector2\u0026amp; vec) const { return Vector2(x + vec.x, y + vec.y); } void operator+=(const Vector2\u0026amp; vec) { x += vec.x, y += vec.y; } Vector2 operator-(const Vector2\u0026amp; vec) const { return Vector2(x - vec.x, y - vec.y); } void operator-=(const Vector2\u0026amp; vec) { x -= vec.x, y -= vec.y; } Vector2 operator*(const Vector2\u0026amp; vec) const { return Vector2(x * vec.x, y * vec.y); } Vector2 operator*(float val) const { return Vector2(x * val, y * val); } void operator*=(float val) { x *= val, y *= val; } float length() { return sqrt(x * x + y * y); } Vector2 normalize() { float len = length(); if (len == 0) { return Vector2(0, 0); } return Vector2(x / len, y / len); } public: float x = 0.0f; float y = 0.0f; }; Implementing the Camera Class Camera Shake Effect This is a common visual effect in games. When firing a weapon or triggering an explosion, the screen shakes briefly to convey impact. It’s simple to implement but highly effective.\nImplementation Strategy Since the shake only lasts for a short time, we need a way to start and stop it. Like animations, this is best handled with a timer.\nImplementing a General-Purpose Timer There are two main design approaches:\nInheritance-based Callback-based Inheritance Approach\nDefine a base Timer class with an on_update method. Subclasses override the callback method to define custom behavior:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 class Timer { public: Timer() = default; ~Timer() = default; void on_update(int delta) { // ...... callback(); } protected: virtual void callback() { // Timer logic } }； To use it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 class MyTimer : public Timer { public: MyTimer() = default; ~MyTimer() = default; protected: void callback() override { // Custom timer logic } }； Timer* my_timer = new MyTimer(); Callback Approach\nSimilar to the Animation class, we store a function and invoke it when the timer completes:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 class Timer { public: Timer() = default; ~Timer() = default; void on_update(int delta) { // ...... callback(); } void set_callback(function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback) { this-\u0026gt;callback = callback; } protected: function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback; } Usage:\n1 2 3 4 5 Timer my_timer; mu_timer.set_back([]() { // Custom timer logic })； Comparison\nThe callback-based approach is more concise and flexible. If you need multiple timers with different behaviors, inheritance requires creating multiple subclasses. With callbacks, you just write a lambda function.\nFor general-purpose timers that only differ in behavior—not data—it’s better to use callbacks. This reduces boilerplate and improves clarity.\nFull Timer Class Implementation\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 // General-purpose timer class // Uses callbacks to define behavior on timeout class Timer { public: Timer() = default; ~Timer() = default; void restart() // Reset the timer { pass_time = 0; shotted = false; } void set_wait_time(int val) { wait_time = val; } void set_one_shot(bool flag) { one_shot = flag; } void set_callback(function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback) { this-\u0026gt;callback = callback; } void pause() { paused = true; } void resume() { paused = false; } void on_update(int delta) { if (paused) return; pass_time += delta; if (pass_time \u0026gt;= wait_time) { if (!one_shot || (one_shot \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !shotted) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; callback) callback(); shotted = true; pass_time = 0; } } private: int pass_time = 0;\t// Elapsed time int wait_time = 0;\t// Wait duration bool paused = false;\t// Pause flag bool shotted = false;\t// Triggered flag bool one_shot = false;\t// One-time trigger function\u0026lt;void()\u0026gt; callback;\t// Callback function }; Camera Class with Integrated Timer Design Approach for Camera Shake Effect\nTo make the entire screen appear to shake, we simply need to shake the camera’s position. In other words, the shake effect is achieved by rapidly changing the coordinates of the Camera object.\nA straightforward approach is to randomly reposition the camera within a circle whose radius equals the shake intensity. Since frame updates happen frequently, this randomness creates a convincing shake effect at runtime.\nFor smoother and more natural motion—especially with stronger shake effects—noise algorithms like Perlin noise can be used instead of pure randomness. However, for the subtle shake used in this project, the visual improvement is minimal, so we stick with the simpler random-based implementation.\nFull Camera Class Implementation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 class Camera { public: Camera() { timer_shake.set_one_shot(true); timer_shake.set_callback([\u0026amp;]() { is_shaking = false; reset(); } ); } ~Camera() = default; const Vector2\u0026amp; get_position() const // First const: returns a read-only reference; second const: ensures this method doesn\u0026#39;t modify the object { return position; } void reset() // Reset camera position to origin { position.x = 0; position.y = 0; } void on_update(int delta) { timer_shake.on_update(delta); if (is_shaking) { position.x = (-50 + rand() % 101) / 50.0f * shaking_strength; position.y = (-50 + rand() % 101) / 50.0f * shaking_strength; } } // Start camera shake effect // Parameters: strength = shake intensity, duration = shake duration in milliseconds void shake(float strength, int duration) void shake(float strength, int duration) { is_shaking = true; shaking_strength = strength; timer_shake.set_wait_time(duration); timer_shake.restart(); } private: Vector2 position;\t// Camera position // Shake effect implementation Timer timer_shake;\t// Timer controlling shake duration bool is_shaking = false; float shaking_strength = 0; // Shake intensity }; In the on_update method, the camera’s position is randomly set within a circle defined by the shake intensity. The random coefficient before shaking_strength represents a value in the range of -1.0 to 1.0, simulating a unit circle.\nWith this, the core game framework is complete.

It has several overloads, but here we’ll use the simplest version: loading an image directly from a file.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // Load image from file (supports bmp/gif/jpg/png/tif/emf/wmf/ico) int loadimage( IMAGE* pDstImg,\t// Pointer to the IMAGE object that stores the image LPCTSTR pImgFile,\t// File path of the image int nWidth = 0,\t// Optional: stretch width度 int nHeight = 0,\t// Optional: stretch height bool bResize = false\t// Optional: resize IMAGE to fit image size ); A few things to note:\nThe first parameter must be a non-null pointer to an IMAGE object. We load the image into memory first, not directly onto the screen. The second parameter is the file path as a string. The last three parameters are optional and control image scaling. We won’t use them in this project. To load an image named test.jpg from the project directory:\n1 2 IMAGE img; loadimage(\u0026amp;img, _T(\u0026#34;test.jpg\u0026#34;)); Rendering Images To draw the image on screen, EasyX provides the putimage function:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // 绘制图像 void putimage( int dstX,\t// X coordinate on screen int dstY,\t// Y coordinate on screen IMAGE *pSrcImg,\t// Pointer to the IMAGE object to draw DWORD dwRop = SRCCOPY\t// Raster operation code (usually ignored) ); The first two parameters specify the position on screen.\nThe last parameter is a raster operation code, which we’ll ignore for this project.\nTo render the image we just loaded:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 // Load image IMAGE img; loadimage(\u0026amp;img, _T(\u0026#34;test.jpg\u0026#34;)); // Draw image putimage(100, 200, \u0026amp;img); If the image is 300 * 300 pixels, it will appear at position (100, 200) on the game screen like this:\nHandling PNG Transparency PNG images may show black edges when rendered. To fix this, we need to create a custom putimage_alpha function that supports transparency using AlphaBlend.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #pragma comment(lib, \u0026#34;MSIMG32.LIB\u0026#34;) void putimage_alpha(int x, int y, IMAGE* img) { int w = img-\u0026gt;getwidth(); int h = img-\u0026gt;getheight(); AlphaBlend(GetImageHDC(NULL), x, y, w, h, GetImageHDC(img), 0, 0, w, h, { AC_SRC_OVER,0,255,AC_SRC_ALPHA }); } Make sure to include the required library at the top of your file: #pragma comment(lib, \u0026quot;MSIMG32.LIB\u0026quot;) .\nImplementing Animation and Rendering How to Make the Scene Move? In game development, character animation is typically implemented in two main ways: frame-by-frame animation and keyframe animation.\nFrame-by-frame animation uses a sequence of images. By displaying these images one after another over time, we create the illusion of motion through visual persistence. Keyframe animation, such as skeletal animation, involves more advanced graphics techniques and won’t be covered here. It’s important to note that we should not use the Sleep() function to control animation timing. Calling Sleep() causes the program to pause, which is a blocking operation. In our game framework, rendering and updates should happen continuously within the game loop, with each loop cycle completing within 1/60 of a second (i.e., 60 FPS). Animation frame switching should be spread across multiple frames—not completed in a single loop. This reflects a core principle in game programming: Avoid blocking operations or heavy tasks inside the main loop.\nTo switch animation frames at fixed intervals, we use a timer-based counter:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 int idx_current_anim = 0;\t// 1. Index of the current animation frame const int PLAYER_ANIM_NUM = 6;\t// Total number of animation frames int main() { ..... while (is_running) { while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { } static int counter = 0;\t// 2. Counts how many game frames have passed // \u0026#39;static\u0026#39; ensures it\u0026#39;s initialized only once // Switch animation frame every 5 game frames if (++counter % 5 == 0) idx_current_anim++; if（idx_current_anim % PLAYER_ANIM_NUM == 0) idx_current_anim = 0; } ...... } Rendering Animation Frames To render animation, we simply draw images from an array in sequence. First, load the frames:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 const int PLAYER_ANIM_NUM = 6;\t// Total number of animation frames IMAGE img_player_left[PLAYER_ANIM_NUM]; IMAGE img_player_right[PLAYER_ANIM_NUM]; void load_animation() { for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; PLAYER_ANIM_NUM; i++) { std::wstring path = L\u0026#34;img/player_left_\u0026#34; + std::to_wstring(i) + L\u0026#34;.png\u0026#34;; loadimage(\u0026amp;img_player_left[i], path.c_str()); } for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; PLAYER_ANIM_NUM; i++) { std::wstring path = L\u0026#34;img/player_right_\u0026#34; + std::to_wstring(i) + L\u0026#34;.png\u0026#34;; loadimage(\u0026amp;img_player_right[i], path.c_str()); } } Then, inside the main loop, draw the current frame:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 int main() { ...... while (is_running)\t// Main game loop { DWORD start_time = GetTickCount(); //========= Handle Input ========= while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { }\t//======== Update ========= cleardevice(); //======== Render ========= putimage_alpha(500, 500, \u0026amp;img_player_left[idx_current_anim]); FlushBatchDraw(); ...... } } This setup ensures smooth animation playback by cycling through frames at a consistent rate.\nEncapsulating Animation into a Class From a data structure perspective, we use a vector\u0026lt;IMAGE*\u0026gt; to store pointers to the images needed for the animation. In the constructor, we load the image resources and allocate memory for each frame. Correspondingly, the destructor is responsible for releasing that memory to avoid leaks.\nWhen playing the animation, we pass not only the position where the animation should be rendered, but also an int delta parameter that represents the time elapsed since the last call to Play(). This replaces the earlier “frame counter” approach with a timer-based system.\nWhy this change? Because animation speed—defined by the frame interval—should depend on actual time, not the game’s frame rate. We want the animation to play at a consistent speed regardless of how fast the game loop runs. Using a time-based timer ensures smoother and more predictable playback than simply incrementing a counter every frame.\nHere’s the implementation:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 class Animation { public: Animation(LPCTSTR path, int num, int interval)\t// Load animation frames { interval_ms = interval; TCHAR path_file[256]; for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; num; i++) { _sprintf_s(path_file, path, i); IMAGE* frame = new IMAGE(); loadimage(frame, path_file); frame_list.push_bacl(frame); } } void Play(int x, int y, int delta)\t// Play animation { timer += delta; if (timer \u0026gt;= interval_ms) { idx_frame = (idx_frame + 1) % frame_list.size(); timer =0; } // Render current frame pitimage_alpha(x, y, frame_list[idx_frame]); } ~Animation()\t// Release resources { for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; frame_list.size(); i++) { delete frame_list[i]; } } private: vector\u0026lt;IMAGE*\u0026gt; frame_list;\t// List of animation frames int interval_ms = 0;\t// Time between frames (in milliseconds) int timer = 0; // Time accumulator int idx_frame = 0; // Current frame index } Implementing Player Movement If we control player movement by directly adding displacement to the position when a key is pressed, it can result in a choppy or inconsistent feel. This happens because WM_KEYDOWN messages are generated asynchronously from the main game loop, and their frequency depends on the operating system and hardware. As a result, some frames may process multiple WM_KEYDOWN messages, while others may receive few or none—causing the player to move unevenly across frames and creating a stuttering effect.\nAdditionally, when a directional key is pressed, the first WM_KEYDOWN message enters the event queue immediately. However, continuous WM_KEYDOWN messages only begin after a short delay if the key remains held down. This behavior contributes further to inconsistent movement.\nTo ensure smooth and consistent movement across all frames, we treat movement as a state:\nWhen a key is pressed (WM_KEYDOWN), the player starts moving. When the key is released (WM_KEYUP), the player stops moving. We use four boolean flags to represent movement directions. These flags are updated based on key press and release events, and the player\u0026rsquo;s position is updated accordingly in each frame:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 void ProcessEvent(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) { if (msg.message == WM_KEYDOWN) { switch (msg.vkcode) { case VK_UP: is_moving_up = true; break; case VK_DOWN: is_moving_down = true; break; case VK_LEFT: is_moving_left = true; break; case VK_RIGHT: is_moving_right = true; break; } } if (msg.message == WM_KEYUP) { switch (msg.vkcode) { case VK_UP: is_moving_up = false; break; case VK_DOWN: is_moving_down = false; break; case VK_LEFT: is_moving_left = false; break; case VK_RIGHT: is_moving_right = false; break; } }\t} void Move() { if (is_moving_up) position.y -= SPEED; if (is_moving_down) position.y += SPEED; if (is_moving_left) position.x -= SPEED; if (is_moving_right) position.x += SPEED; } To prevent the player from moving faster diagonally than horizontally or vertically, we normalize the movement vector. This ensures consistent speed in all directions:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 int dir_x = is_move_right - is_move_left; int dir_y = is_move_down - is_move_up; double len_dir = sqrt(dir_x * dir_x + dir_y + dir_y); if(len_dir != 0) { double normalized_x = dir_x / len_dir; double normalized_y = dir_y / len_dir; player_pos.x += (int)(PLAYER_SPEED * normalized_x); player_pos.y += (int)(PLAYER_SPEED * normalized_y); } Class Encapsulation To prevent data and logic from being scattered across the project, each object’s behavior and data are encapsulated into dedicated classes. For example, the Player class is structured roughly as follows:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 class Player { public: Player() { // Initialize resources: animation frames, image assets, etc. } ~Player() { // Release resources } void ProcessEvent(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) { // Handle player input } void Move() { // Handle player movement } void Draw(int delta) { // Render the player } private: // Internal data members ...... } Enemy Class Implementation Details Random Enemy Spawning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 // Define spawn edges enum class SpawnEdge { Up = 0, Down, Left, Right }; // Randomly select one edge SpawnEdge edge = (SpawnEdge)(rand() % 4); // Assign spawn coordinates based on selected edge switch (edge) { case SpawnEdge::Up: position.x = rand() % WINDOW_WIDTH; position.y = -FRAME_HEIGHT; break; case SpawnEdge::Down: position.x = rand() % WINDOW_WIDTH; position.y = WINDOW_HEIGHT; break; case SpawnEdge::Left: position.x = -FRAME_WIDTH; position.y = rand() % WINDOW_HEIGHT; break; case SpawnEdge::Right: position.x = WINDOW_WIDTH; position.y = rand () % WINDOW_HEIGHT; break; default: break; } Enemy Pathfinding Logic Each enemy automatically moves toward the player by calculating the direction vector between their positions and normalizing it. This ensures consistent movement speed regardless of distance:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 void Move(const Player\u0026amp; player) { const POINT\u0026amp; player_position = player.GetPosition(); int dir_x = player_position.x - position.x; int dir_y = player_position.y - position.y; double dir_len = sqrt(dir_x * dir_x + dir_y * dir_y); if (dir_len != 0) { double normalized_x = dir_x / dir_len; double normalized_y = dir_y / dir_len; position.x += (int)(normalized_x * SPEED); position.y += (int)(normalized_y * SPEED); } // Update facing direction based on horizontal movement if (dir_x \u0026gt; 0) facing_left = false; else if (dir_x \u0026lt; 0) facing_left = true; } Implementing 2D Collision Detection All collision logic is implemented within the Enemy class. To avoid unnecessary copying, the Player and Bullet objects are passed by reference.\nEnemy vs. Bullet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 bool CheckBulletCollision(const Bullet\u0026amp; bullet) // \u0026#39;const\u0026#39; ensures the bullet won\u0026#39;t be modified { // Treat the bullet as a point and check if it\u0026#39;s inside the enemy\u0026#39;s rectangle bool is_overlap_x = bullet.position.x \u0026gt;= position.x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; bullet.position.x \u0026lt;= position.x + FRAME_WIDTH; bool is_overlap_y = bullet.position.y \u0026gt;= position.y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; bullet.position.y \u0026lt;= position.y + FRAME_HEIGHT; return is_overlap_x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is_overlap_y; } Enemy vs. Player In most games, collision detection isn\u0026rsquo;t overly strict. If both the enemy and player are treated as rectangles, it’s possible for only a corner to overlap visually without feeling like a real collision—leading to confusion. To improve the experience, hitboxes are often smaller than the actual image size.\nHere, we treat the enemy’s center point as the collision point and check if it overlaps with the player’s rectangle:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 bool CheckPlayerCollision(const Player\u0026amp; player) { // Use the enemy\u0026#39;s center point as the collision point POINT check_position = { position.x + FRAME_WIDTH / 2, position.y + FRAME_HEIGHT / 2 }; bool is_overlap_x = check_position.x \u0026gt;= player.GetPosition().x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; check_position.x \u0026lt;= player.GetPosition().x + player.FRAME_WIDTH; bool is_overlap_y = check_position.y \u0026gt;= player.GetPosition().y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; check_position.y \u0026lt;= player.GetPosition().y + player.FRAME_HEIGHT; return is_overlap_x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; is_overlap_y; } Bullet Updates and Visual Effects The bullets orbiting the player are handled as a group of three and updated using a global function.\nTo create a dynamic visual effect, we animate the bullets by adjusting their angle (α) over time. All angles are calculated in radians for simplicity:\nHere’s the corresponding code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 // Update bullet positions void UpdateBullets(vector\u0026lt;Bullet\u0026gt;\u0026amp; bullet_list, const Player\u0026amp; player) { // Create a pulsating effect for visual flair const double RADIAL_SPEED = 0.0045; // Speed of radial oscillation const double TANGENT_SPEED = 0.0055; // Speed of tangential rotation double radian_interval = 2 * PI / bullet_list.size(); // Angular spacing between bullets // Update each bullet\u0026#39;s position based on the player\u0026#39;s location POINT player_position = player.GetPosition(); double radius = BULLET_BASE_RADIUS + BULLET_RADIUS_CHANGE_RANGE * sin(GetTickCount() * RADIAL_SPEED); for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; bullet_list.size(); i++) { double radian = GetTickCount() * TANGENT_SPEED + radian_interval * i; bullet_list[i].position.x = player_position.x + player.FRAME_WIDTH / 2 + (int)(radius * sin(radian)); bullet_list[i].position.y = player_position.y + player.FRAME_HEIGHT / 2 + (int)(radius * cos(radian)); } } Removing Defeated Enemies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 // Iterate through the enemy list and remove defeated enemies for (size_t i = 0; i \u0026lt; enemy_list.size(); i++) // Avoid using iterators since the // container is modified during iteration { Enemy* enemy = enemy_list[i]; if (!enemy-\u0026gt;CheckAlive()) { // Swap with the last element and remove it // * This is an efficient deletion method when element order doesn\u0026#39;t matter swap(enemy_list[i], enemy_list.back()); enemy_list.pop_back(); delete enemy; } } Playing Sound Effects This project uses Windows API functions to play sound. Here’s how to do it:\n1 2 3 4 5 // Open the bgm.mp3 file located in the mus folder and assign it the alias \u0026#34;bgm\u0026#34; mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;open mus/bgm.mp3 alias bgm\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL);\t// Load sound // Play the sound with alias \u0026#34;bgm\u0026#34; in a loop starting from the beginning mciSendString(_T(\u0026#34;play bgm repeat from 0\u0026#34;), NULL, 0, NULL);\t// Remove \u0026#39;repeat\u0026#39; if looping is not needed\tPerformance Optimization: Using the Flyweight Pattern Game assets like models and textures often consume significant disk space and increase loading time. The Flyweight pattern is commonly used in game development to optimize resource usage.\nHere’s a comparison between a typical implementation and a Flyweight-based one:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 //========= Typical Implementation ========= struct Tree { Model model;\t// Tree model Texture texture;// Tree texture int x, y, z;\t// Tree position } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 //======= Flyweight Implementation ======= // Shared asset structure // All trees use the same TreeAsset instance for model and texture struct TreeAsset { Model model;\t// Tree model Texture texture;// Tree texture } // Tree instance structure struct Tree { TreeAsset* asset;\t// Pointer to shared asset int x, y, z;\t// Tree position } In this project, we refactor the Animation class to separate shared and instance-specific data. The shared data—std::vector\u0026lt;IMAGE*\u0026gt; frame_list—is stored in an Atlas class, while each enemy instance maintains its own animation state.\nShared image data is managed by the Atlas class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 // Optimized resource loading class Atlas { public: Atlas(LPCTSTR path, int num) { // Load image frames TCHAR path_file[256]; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; num; i++) { _stprintf_s(path_file, path, i); IMAGE* frame = new IMAGE(); loadimage(frame, path_file); frame_list.push_back(frame); } } ~Atlas() { for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; frame_list.size(); i++) { delete frame_list[i]; } } public: vector\u0026lt;IMAGE*\u0026gt; frame_list; }; Instance-specific animation logic is encapsulated in the Animation class:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 class Animation { public: Animation(Atlas* atlas, int interval) { anim_atlas = atlas; interval_ms = interval; } ~Animation() = default; // The atlas is shared, so we don\u0026#39;t delete it here // It should be released at a higher level (e.g., in main) // Also, we didn\u0026#39;t allocate it with \u0026#39;new\u0026#39; here // Play animation void Play(int x, int y, int delta_time) { timer += delta_time; if (timer \u0026gt;= interval_ms) { idx_frame = (idx_frame + 1) % anim_atlas-\u0026gt;frame_list.size(); timer = 0; } putimage_alpha(x, y, anim_atlas-\u0026gt;frame_list[idx_frame]); } private: int interval_ms = 0;// Frame interval int timer = 0;\t// Animation timer int idx_frame = 0; // Current frame index private: Atlas* anim_atlas; // Pointer to shared atlas }; Button Class Design A button can have three states: Idle, Hovered, and Pushed. Understanding the transitions between these states is key to implementing input logic:\nAccordingly, we need to handle three types of input events: mouse movement, left mouse button press, and left mouse button release.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 void ProcessEvent(const ExMessage\u0026amp; msg) { switch (msg.message) { case WM_MOUSEMOVE: if (status == Status::Idle \u0026amp;\u0026amp; CheckCursorHit(msg.x, msg.y)) status = Status::Hovered; else if (status == Status::Idle \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !CheckCursorHit(msg.x, msg.y)) status = Status::Idle; else if (status == Status::Hovered \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !CheckCursorHit(msg.x, msg.y)) status = Status::Idle; break; case WM_LBUTTONDOWN: if (CheckCursorHit(msg.x, msg.y)) status = Status::Pushed; break; case WM_LBUTTONUP: if (status == Status::Pushed) OnClick(); break; default: break; } } Extras: Animation Effects \u0026amp; Pixel Buffers Color Basics An image is made up of pixels, and each pixel’s color is determined by the three primary colors: Red, Green, and Blue—commonly referred to as RGB. These components are mixed at varying intensities to produce different colors. A simple Color structure can be defined as:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 struct Color { int r; int g; int b; }; Essentially, an image is a 2D array of pixels. For example, a ``100*100 image can be represented asColor image[100][100]`. Rendering an image to the window involves copying this smaller array into the larger pixel buffer of the window. The drawing coordinates determine the pixel index.\nIn EasyX, the IMAGE class contains a pointer DWORD* m_pBuffer that points to the image’s pixel buffer. Internally, the pixel data is stored in memory from left to right, top to bottom. To access the color of a pixel at (x, y), you would use:\nIn array form: Color pix_color = image[y][x] In EasyX: DWORD pix_color = buffer[y * width + x] (where width is the image width) You can retrieve the pixel buffer using EasyX’s API: DWORD* buffer = GetImageBuffer(\u0026amp;image). Each DWORD element occupies 4 bytes and stores RGBA data (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha).\nImplementing Image Flip Effects Start by loading the original animation frames for the player facing left. Then define a new array for the flipped (right-facing) frames. Each left-facing image is horizontally flipped to create its right-facing counterpart.\nBefore flipping, we use Resize to allocate memory and set the size of the right-facing IMAGE objects. If an IMAGE object is not created via copy constructor or loadimage, its pixel buffer is uninitialized—so Resize also handles memory allocation.\nNext, we retrieve the pixel buffers of both the left and right images and copy each pixel row by row. The horizontal flip is achieved by reversing the x-axis index: width - 1 - x.\nLoading left-facing animation frames:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 IMAGE img_player_left[6]; // Load player left-facing animation for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 6; i++) { static TCHAR img_path[256]; _stprintf_s(img_path, _T(\u0026#34;img/paimon_left_\u0026amp;d.png\u0026#34;), i); loadimage(\u0026amp;img_player_left[i], img_path); } Creating right-facing flipped frames:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 IMAGE img_player_right[6]; for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 6; i++) { int width = img_player_left[i].getwidth(); int height = img_player_left[i].getheight(); Resize(\u0026amp;img_player_right[i], width, height);\t// Resize and allocate memory for right-facing image // Flip each row horizontally DWORD* color_buffer_left_img = GetImageBuffer(\u0026amp;img_player_left[i]); DWORD* color_buffer_right_img = GetImageBuffer(\u0026amp;img_player_right[i]); for (int y = 0; y \u0026lt; height; y++) { for (int x = 0; x \u0026lt; width; x++) { int idx_left_img = y * width + x;\t// Source pixel index int idx_right_img = y * width + (width - 1 - x);\t// Target pixel index color_buffer_right_img[idx_right_img] = color_buffer_left_img[idx_left_img]; } } } Extracting RGB Components from Each Pixel EasyX provides three macros—GetGValue, GetRValue, and GetBValue—to extract the individual RGB components from a pixel. However, note that the commonly used COLORREF type (a 32-bit integer representing color) is stored in memory as 0xbbggrr, meaning the red and blue channels are swapped. So when using EasyX macros, you need to reverse the R and B components:\n1 2 3 4 DWORD pix_color = buffer[y * width + x]; BYTE r = GetBValue(pix_color); BYTE g = GetGValue(pix_color); BYTE b = GetRValue(pix_color); Implementing Image Flicker Effect The flicker effect is essentially a switch between the normal animation frames and a set of pure white silhouette frames. These silhouette frames can be dynamically generated by manipulating the pixel buffer.\nTo set a pixel to pure white, you can use the RGB macro to create a COLORREF value, then swap the red and blue channels using BGR, and finally add an alpha channel:\n1 2 3 4 // RGB(255, 255, 255) gives 0x00FFFFFF // Adding full opacity: (BYTE)(255) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 24 = 0xFF000000 // Combined: 0xFFFFFFFF = fully opaque white DWORD white_pix = BGR(RGB(255, 255, 255)) | (((DWORD)(BYTE)(255)) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 24); To implement the image flicker effect, the basic idea is to first define an array of silhouette animation frames. Then, for each original image frame, use Resize to match its size and allocate memory for the silhouette frame. After that, retrieve the color buffers of both the original and silhouette images. In a nested loop, check the color of each pixel—if the pixel is not already white, set it to pure white：\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 IMAGE img_player_left_sketch[6]; // Generate silhouette frames for left-facing animation for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 6; i++) { int width = img_player_left[i].getwidth(); int height = img_player_left[i].getheight(); Resize(\u0026amp;img_player_left_sketch[i], width, height);\t// Allocate memory and set size DWORD* color_buffer_raw_img = GetImageBuffer(\u0026amp;img_player_left[i]); DWORD* color_buffer_sketch_img = GetImageBuffer(\u0026amp;img_player_left_sketch[i]); for (int y = 0; y \u0026lt; height; y++) { for (int x = 0; x \u0026lt; width; x++) { int idx = y * width + x; if ((color_buffer_raw_img[idx] \u0026amp; 0xFF000000) \u0026gt;\u0026gt; 24)\t// If pixel is not fully transparent color_buffer_sketch_img[idx] = BGR(RGB(255, 255, 255)) | (((DWORD)(BYTE)(255)) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 24); } } } Implementing Freeze Effect Principle of Alpha Blending EasyX doesn’t automatically handle transparency. When alpha blending is applied, the final pixel color is calculated as: Final Color = Source Color * Alpha + Destination Color * （1 - Alpha）. Here, Alpha is a float between 0 and 1. For example, overlaying a green image on a red background would blend the colors based on this formula:\nImage Overlay Without Alpha Blending Image Overlay With Alpha Blending and the Formula To simulate a freeze effect, overlay a semi-transparent icy image on top of the current animation frame.

BYTE r = (BYTE)(GetBValue(color_frame_img) * RATIO + GetBValue(color_ice_img) * (1 - RATIO)); BYTE g = (BYTE)(GetGValue(color_frame_img) * RATIO + GetGValue(color_ice_img) * (1 - RATIO)); BYTE b = (BYTE)(GetRValue(color_frame_img) * RATIO + GetRValue(color_ice_img) * (1 - RATIO)); // Blend with the Alpha channel color_buffer_frame_img[idx] = (BGR(RGB(r, g, b)) | (((DWORD)(BYTE)(255)) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 24); } } } Enhancement: Adding Highlight to Frozen State To make the freeze effect more vivid, add a white scanning line from top to bottom. Only pixels with brightness above a threshold will be highlighted.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 void RenderFrozenPlayer() { static const POINT position = { 1075, 345};

The instructor started with the overall game framework and gradually refined each module, clearly demonstrating the problems encountered in each part and the thought process behind solving them. This was highly valuable for my own development practice.\nI also gained a deeper understanding of how animations work at the pixel level, supplemented my knowledge of color and image buffers, and reviewed key concepts like vector motion and 2D collision detection. Through a simple yet hands-on example, I finally grasped the purpose of the Flyweight pattern and design patterns in general. It often felt like a moment of sudden clarity—like fog lifting to reveal the sky.\nLooking ahead, there are two areas I need to explore further. First is 3D collision detection and related topics. Although I studied them in school through traditional textbook exercises, I didn’t encounter any real development examples, so my memory is vague and I feel like I’ve forgotten most of it. Second is design patterns in game development. Back then, I read the books and answered questions in a very mechanical way, often feeling lost and confused. I plan to continue learning from this instructor’s design pattern courses to gain a more practical and intuitive understanding through real-world application.\n","date":"2025-10-08T10:47:30+02:00","image":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/c-game-dev-from-scratchteyvat-survivors/cover_hu_5cfa909519d6e81c.webp","permalink":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/c-game-dev-from-scratchteyvat-survivors/","title":"【C++ Game Dev from Scratch】Teyvat Survivors"},{"content":"Table of Contents\nTerms Industry Expressions for Game \u0026amp; IT Developers Idiomatic Expressions For Interviews and Project Communication Terms Expression Meaning Usage Scenario polymorphism The ability of different objects to respond to the same function call in different ways.

Idiomatic Expressions Expression Meaning Usage “Let’s refactor this module.” Suggest improving the code structure to make it cleaner or more efficient. During a code review or when planning technical debt cleanup. “This function is too tightly coupled.” The function depends too much on other parts of the code, making it hard to reuse or test. When discussing code design problems. “Can we abstract this logic?” Suggest extracting common logic into a reusable function or class. While reviewing repetitive code or planning modularization. “This breaks the single responsibility principle.” The code does too many things and should be split into smaller parts. When evaluating class or function design. “Let’s keep it DRY.” Avoid repeating the same code in multiple places. During refactoring or team discussions. “This is a bit verbose.” The code or explanation is too long or detailed. When suggesting simplification. “It’s more idiomatic to use…” This way of writing is more natural or standard in this programming language. When giving style or best practice advice. “Let’s decouple the UI from the logic.” Separate the user interface from the underlying code logic. When designing front-end architecture. “This is a good candidate for a helper function.” This piece of code can be moved into a reusable function. During code cleanup or review. “We should avoid side effects here.” The function should not change external states unexpectedly. When writing pure or predictable functions.

It also serves as part of my portfolio. Tech Stack: GitHub Pages + Hugo, with lightweight customizations based on the Stack theme. Start Date: 2025-09-14 Current Status: In progress Learning Resources: Hugo official docs, Stack theme docs, tutorials from Bilibili and other creators online. Repository: GitHub Timeline - Phase One 2025-09-14 Goals： Set up the site and enable auto-deployment Add a basic version of the animated character widget Issues： Page not found when switching between Chinese and English Website tab icon not showing Solutions: Used GitHub Copilot in VS Code to help write a JS file for language switching Tested with icons that worked on other websites to rule out image issues; the icon eventually appeared after I worked on other modules Thoughts: I need to learn web programming systematically while developing, so I can understand not just how things work, but why GitHub Pages deploys quickly, but changes may take time to show. If the repo is updated but the site hasn’t refreshed, just wait a bit 2025-09-16 Goals: Add an Update Log to the sidebar Upload the first blog post (Chinese version) Change fonts Use a custom cursor Issue: Custom cursor not showing Solution: Found in the tutorial’s comment section that the issue might be with the image. Tested with the blogger’s image and it worked Thoughts: Comments under articles or videos can be very helpful—others may have already solved the same problem 2025-09-18 Goal: Finish a round of basic visual improvements Issues: Unsure how to apply specific fonts to different languages and code blocks Syntax error during auto-deployment Solutions: Used Copilot’s suggestions to fix the font issue Syntax error was due to indentation. VS Code auto-formatted incorrectly, so I switched to Notepad to fix it Thoughts: Front-end code is sensitive to indentation. Better to use Notepad or other editors instead of VS Code for certain tasks 2025-09-19 Goals:\nContinue visual improvements Adjust icons and text for Color Scheme Add dynamic background Add blog view counter Issue:\nAfter fixing overlapping icons, text formatting still didn’t align with other sidebar items Notes：\nTried for quite a while without success \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it for now and revisit it after I’ve studied more front-end\n2025-09-20 Goals:\nContinue visual improvements Add homepage loading animation Add footer animation Add blog post heatmap Issues:\nUnrelated text appeared at the bottom of the site Tried adding animation to the icon below the avatar but it didn’t work Solution:\nAI helped identify the issue: I used C++ style comments in custom.html, which browsers treated as text Notes：\nWill revisit the small icon animation after learning more front-end (fixed on 9-23) Thoughts:\nComment syntax varies a lot between languages - important to follow the correct format strictly 2025-09-22 Goal：\nContinue visual improvements Issue：\nLink page card images couldn’t be resized uniformly Notes：\nStill couldn’t solve the issue, so I’ve manually adjusted each image for now. Will come back to unify the layout after I’ve learned more front-end 2025-09-23 Goals:\nAdd RSS feeds for language-specific subscriptions Upgrade character widget2D to moc3 version Add footer animation Add blog post heatmap Issue:\nCharacter model failed to load Solution:\nUsed browser dev tools to debug. AI helped identify a missing \\ in the model folder path Thoughts:\nAlways double-check file paths Dev tools are super useful for debugging 2025-09-24 Goals:\nAdd a new character model and customize all parameters Issues:\nNew model failed to load jsDelivr didn’t load newly pushed files Solutions:\nDev tools showed the model was too large, so I decided to abandon it Learned from AI that jsDelivr caches tags and doesn’t auto-update. Used precise loading to avoid cluttering the repo Thoughts:\nFirst time realizing how important file size is for web delivery. Just like managing game assets in later stages of Brotato, each programming domain has its own key concerns that you only grasp through hands-on experience 2025-09-29 Goals:\nAdd runtime statistics and article count to the bottom of the webpage Issues:\nChinese characters appeared as garbled text Solutions:\nFollowed AI’s suggestion to inspect the file using VS Code. Found that the encoding was incorrect under UTF-8. After adjusting the encoding, the characters displayed correctly Thoughts:\nOpening the file in VS 2022 did not reveal any encoding issues, but VS Code clearly exposed the problem However, after editing in VS Code, clicking Save would automatically change the file format, causing Hugo to fail during compilation Phase One Summary Progress:\nFinished initial setup of the tech blog, including auto-deployment and basic visual customization Takeaways:\nLearned the basics of static site generators (config → template → render) Got familiar with GitHub Pages deployment Didn’t study front-end formally during this phase—relied on tutorials and AI.

Understand the basic structure of a game loop.\nCourse Source：Bilibili-Voidmatrix\nEnvironment Setup EasyX: Just search for “EasyX” and download it directly from the official site.\nTo use EasyX functions, include \u0026lt;graphics.h\u0026gt; in your header file.\nDemo1 - Circle Follows Mouse Design Approach Create a window and set up the main game loop Draw a circle that follows the mouse Optimize rendering using double buffering Development Steps Initialize Window and Main Loop Use initgraph() to initialize the window, and a while (true) loop to prevent it from closing instantly:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 int main() { initgraph(1280, 720); while (true) { } return 0; } This infinite loop is the basic framework for all games. Input handling and screen updates happen inside it:\n1 2 3 4 5 while (true) { // Handle player input // Update screen } Draw the Circle Use solidcircle() to draw the circle.\nHandle Input Use peekmessage() to process input.\nIn EasyX, mouse movement, clicks, and keyboard input are all considered “messages.” These messages are stored in a queue. Each time peekmessage() is called, EasyX tries to pull one message from the queue. If successful, it returns true; otherwise, false. So we use another loop to keep pulling messages until the queue is empty.\nAccording to the docs, peekmessage() requires a parameter msg, which is a pointer to an ExMessage struct. One of its members, message, indicates the type of input (mouse, keyboard, etc.). So the input handling looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 while (true) { ExMessage msg; while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { if (msg == WM_MOUSEMOVE) { // Handle mouse movement } } } Clear Screen If you don’t clear the screen, the ball will leave a trail as it follows the mouse. Use cleardevice() before each draw.\nOptimize Drawing with Double Buffering Use BeginBatchDraw(), FlushBatchDraw(), and EndBatchDraw():\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 BeginBatchDraw(); while (true) // Main game loop { // Handle input // Update game state cleardevice(); // Clear screen // Draw FlushBatchDraw(); } EndBatchDraw(); Key Functions initgraph() – initialize graphics window peekmessage() – get mouse movement messages cleardevice() – clear screen solidcircle(x, y, r) – draw circle BeginBatchDraw(), FlushBatchDraw(), EndBatchDraw() – double buffering Concepts EasyX Coordinate System Origin is at the top-left of the screen. X increases to the right, Y increases downward.\nRender Buffer Think of the render buffer as a giant canvas. Drawing functions paint on it. Earlier drawings can be covered by later ones. cleardevice() fills the canvas with the current background color (default is black).\nBeginBatchDraw() creates a new invisible canvas. All drawing happens on this canvas until FlushBatchDraw() and EndBatchDraw() swap it with the visible one. This prevents flickering caused by frequent redraws.\nGame Loop A typical game loop repeatedly performs:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 while (true) { // Read input // Process data // Render screen } Initialize game data before the loop (before BeginBatchDraw()), and release resources after the loop ends.\nDemo2 - Tic-Tac-Toe Game Game Description Players take turns placing X or O on a 3 * 3 grid. If one player gets three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win. If all nine cells are filled with no winner, it’s a draw. This demo supports local two-player mode only.\nDesign Approach Three Core Elements in the Game Loop Input: Handle mouse left-clicks. If a blank cell is clicked, place a piece.\nData Processing: Check for game-over conditions: three matching pieces in a line or full board. If the game ends, show a popup and exit the loop.\nRendering: Use line() to draw the grid and X pieces (diagonal lines), and circle() for O pieces. Display the current piece type in the top-left corner.\nData Structures Board and Pieces: Use a 2D array char board_data[3][3] for the board. Use 'X' and 'O' for pieces, and '-' for empty cells.\nGame Over Conditions Win: Check all 8 possible winning combinations for both X and O.\nDraw: If no '-' remains and no winner, it’s a draw.\nDevelopment Steps Top-Down Approach Start with the framework, then fill in details.\nGame Loop Skeleton Use bool running to control the loop. Use CheckWin() and CheckDraw() to determine game status.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 bool running = true; ExMessage msg; BeginBatchDraw(); while (running) // Main game loop { while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { // Input } // Data processing if (CheckWin(\u0026#39;X\u0026#39;)) { // Pop up message and end the game MessageBox(GetHWnd(), _T(\u0026#34;X Player wins\u0026#34;), _T(\u0026#34;Game over\u0026#34;), MB_OK); running = false; } else if (CheckWin(\u0026#39;O\u0026#39;)) { // Similar logic to the above } else if (CheckDraw()) { // Similar logic to the above } cleardevice(); // Draw all the objects DrawBoard(); DrawPiece(); DrawPrompt(); FlushBatchDraw(); } EndBatchDraw(); Input Logic Mouse coordinates are in pixels. Convert them to grid indices:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 int x = msg.x; // Pixel indices of mouse int y = msg.y; int index_x = x / 200; // Grid indices of mouse int index_y = y / 200; Then place the piece and switch to the other type.\nData Processing Logic CheckWin() uses brute-force to check 8 patterns.\nCheckDraw() loops through all cells to check for '-'.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 for (int col = 0; col \u0026lt; 3; col++) { for (int row = 0; row \u0026lt; 3; row++) { if (board[row][col] == \u0026#39;-\u0026#39;) { } } } Rendering Logic Board: Use line() with pixel coordinates.\nX Pieces: Use diagonal line() calls.\nO Pieces: Use circle() with center offset by +100 pixels.\nDrawing the prompt message: To make it work in more general coding environments, used some less common types and functions \u0026ndash; but they work similarly to C’s printf().\n1 2 static TCHAR str[64]; _stprintf_s(str, _T(\u0026#34;Current piece type：%c\u0026#34;), current_piece); Some font styling functions：\n1 2 settextcolor(RGB(225, 175, 45)); // Set the text color to orange for better visual //\temphasis; outtextxy(0, 0, str); // Display the string at a specified position Optimization Last Piece Not Drawn: If win-check happens before drawing, the popup blocks rendering. So draw first, then check.\nHigh CPU Usage: When a computer runs a while loop, it executes extremely fast—our main game loop can complete thousands of iterations in an instant, consuming a large amount of CPU time. For most displays with a physical refresh rate of only 60Hz, this leads to unnecessary performance waste. A quick and crude solution is to use sleep(15) to force the program to pause for 15 milliseconds after each loop. However, this isn’t recommended. As the game grows in complexity, the amount of computation per loop can vary, depending on how the operating system allocates CPU resources. This means the actual time spent per loop may differ. So instead, we should calculate how long each frame takes to process and dynamically adjust the sleep time afterward. The recommended approach is to set a fixed frame rate manually. To do this, we use the GetTickCount() function, which returns the number of milliseconds since the program started running.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 while (running) { DWORD start_time = GetTickCount(); // Get the start time of the current loop // Read input // Process data // Render screen DWORD end_time = GetTickCount(); // Get the end time of the current loop DWORD delta_time = end_time - start_time; // Calculate the time interval // Dynamically assign sleep time based on the interval // Refresh the screen at 60 frames per second if (delta_time \u0026lt; 1000 / 60) // If the interval is less than the time for one frame, // sleep; Otherwise, no need to sleep { Sleep(1000 / 60 - delta_time); } } // Release resources } Full source code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 #include \u0026lt;graphics.h\u0026gt;

I’ve used C++ and raylib before, but mostly by copying code without fully grasping it. This time, I followed the tutorial step by step, focusing on fast and simple implementation rather than object-oriented design. I used a top-down approach: build the framework first, then solve each problem one by one.\nI plan to finish all of VoidMatrix’s tutorials to improve my coding skills and deepen my understanding of game development. I also want to align my coding style with industry standards.\n","date":"2025-09-18T09:11:30+02:00","image":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/c-game-dev-from-scratchfundamental/cover_hu_c9d732c287ad5881.webp","permalink":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/c-game-dev-from-scratchfundamental/","title":"【C++ Game Dev from Scratch】Fundamental"}]
