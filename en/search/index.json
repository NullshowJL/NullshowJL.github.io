Repository: GitHub Timeline \u0026ndash; Phase One 2025-09-14 Goals： Set up the site and enable auto-deployment Add a basic version of the animated character widget Issues： Page not found when switching between Chinese and English Website tab icon not showing Solutions: Used GitHub Copilot in VS Code to help write a JS file for language switching Tested with icons that worked on other websites to rule out image issues; the icon eventually appeared after I worked on other modules Thoughts: I need to learn web programming systematically while developing, so I can understand not just how things work, but why GitHub Pages deploys quickly, but changes may take time to show. If the repo is updated but the site hasn’t refreshed, just wait a bit 2025-09-16 Goals: Add an Update Log to the sidebar Upload the first blog post (Chinese version) Change fonts Use a custom cursor Issue: Custom cursor not showing Solution: Found in the tutorial’s comment section that the issue might be with the image. Tested with the blogger’s image and it worked Thoughts: Comments under articles or videos can be very helpful—others may have already solved the same problem 2025-09-18 Goal: Finish a round of basic visual improvements Issues: Unsure how to apply specific fonts to different languages and code blocks Syntax error during auto-deployment Solutions: Used Copilot’s suggestions to fix the font issue Syntax error was due to indentation. VS Code auto-formatted incorrectly, so I switched to Notepad to fix it Thoughts: Front-end code is sensitive to indentation. Better to use Notepad or other editors instead of VS Code for certain tasks 2025-09-19 Goals:\nContinue visual improvements Adjust icons and text for Color Scheme Add dynamic background Add blog view counter Issue:\nAfter fixing overlapping icons, text formatting still didn’t align with other sidebar items Notes：\nTried for quite a while without success \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;ll leave it for now and revisit it after I’ve studied more front-end\n2025-09-20 Goals:\nContinue visual improvements Add homepage loading animation Add footer animation Add blog post heatmap Issues:\nUnrelated text appeared at the bottom of the site Tried adding animation to the icon below the avatar but it didn’t work Solution:\nAI helped identify the issue: I used C++ style comments in custom.html, which browsers treated as text Notes：\nWill revisit the small icon animation after learning more front-end (fixed on 9-23) Thoughts:\nComment syntax varies a lot between languages - important to follow the correct format strictly 2025-09-22 Goal：\nContinue visual improvements Issue：\nLink page card images couldn’t be resized uniformly Notes：\nStill couldn’t solve the issue, so I’ve manually adjusted each image for now. Will come back to unify the layout after I’ve learned more front-end 2025-09-23 Goals:\nAdd RSS feeds for language-specific subscriptions Upgrade character widget2D to moc3 version Add footer animation Add blog post heatmap Issue:\nCharacter model failed to load Solution:\nUsed browser dev tools to debug. AI helped identify a missing \\ in the model folder path Thoughts:\nAlways double-check file paths Dev tools are super useful for debugging 2025-09-24 Goals:\nAdd a new character model and customize all parameters Issues:\nNew model failed to load jsDelivr didn’t load newly pushed files Solutions:\nDev tools showed the model was too large, so I decided to abandon it Learned from AI that jsDelivr caches tags and doesn’t auto-update. Used precise loading to avoid cluttering the repo Thoughts:\nFirst time realizing how important file size is for web delivery.

Learned how to ask AI better questions to solve problems Next Steps:\nStudy front-end systematically and revisit unresolved issues Read and understand the customized parts of the code Keep updating the site based on my TODO list ","date":"2025-09-24T09:11:30+02:00","image":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/dev-logmy-tech-blog-website/blog-en_hu_5ee5269ebd73980f.webp","permalink":"https://nullshowjl.github.io/en/p/dev-logmy-tech-blog-website/","title":"【Dev Log】My Tech Blog Website"},{"content":"Overview Tech Stack：C++ + EasyX\nProject Goal: Set up the EasyX environment and complete two small demos (a circle that follows the mouse, and a tic-tac-toe game). Understand the basic structure of a game loop.\nCourse Source：Bilibli-VoidMatrix\nEnvironment Setup EasyX: Just search for “EasyX” and download it directly from the official site.\nTo use EasyX functions, include \u0026lt;graphics.h\u0026gt; in your header file.\nDemo1 - Circle Follows Mouse Design Concept Create a window and set up the main game loop Draw a circle that follows the mouse Optimize rendering using double buffering Development Steps Initialize Window and Main Loop Use initgraph() to initialize the window, and a while (true) loop to prevent it from closing instantly:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 int main() { initgraph(1280, 720); while (true) { } return 0; } This infinite loop is the basic framework for all games. Input handling and screen updates happen inside it:\n1 2 3 4 5 while (true) { // Handle player input // Update screen } Draw the Circle Use solidcircle() to draw the circle.\nHandle Input Use peekmessage() to process input.\nIn EasyX, mouse movement, clicks, and keyboard input are all considered “messages.” These messages are stored in a queue. Each time peekmessage() is called, EasyX tries to pull one message from the queue. If successful, it returns true; otherwise, false. So we use another loop to keep pulling messages until the queue is empty.\nAccording to the docs, peekmessage() requires a parameter msg, which is a pointer to an ExMessage struct. One of its members, message, indicates the type of input (mouse, keyboard, etc.). So the input handling looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 while (true) { ExMessage msg; while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { if (msg == WM_MOUSEMOVE) { // Handle mouse movement } } } Clear Screen If you don’t clear the screen, the ball will leave a trail as it follows the mouse. Use cleardevice() before each draw.\nOptimize Drawing with Double Buffering Use BeginBatchDraw(), FlushBatchDraw(), and EndBatchDraw():\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 BeginBatchDraw(); while (true) // Main game loop { // Handle input // Update game state cleardevice(); // Clear screen // Draw FlushBatchDraw(); } EndBatchDraw(); Key Functions initgraph() – initialize graphics window peekmessage() – get mouse movement messages cleardevice() – clear screen solidcircle(x, y, r) – draw circle BeginBatchDraw(), FlushBatchDraw(), EndBatchDraw() – double buffering Concepts EasyX Coordinate System Origin is at the top-left of the screen. X increases to the right, Y increases downward.\nRender Buffer Think of the render buffer as a giant canvas. Drawing functions paint on it. Earlier drawings can be covered by later ones. cleardevice() fills the canvas with the current background color (default is black).\nBeginBatchDraw() creates a new invisible canvas. All drawing happens on this canvas until FlushBatchDraw() and EndBatchDraw() swap it with the visible one. This prevents flickering caused by frequent redraws.\nGame Loop A typical game loop repeatedly performs:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 while (true) { // Read input // Process data // Render screen } Initialize game data before the loop (before BeginBatchDraw()), and release resources after the loop ends.\nDemo2 - Tic-Tac-Toe Game Game Description Players take turns placing X or O on a 3 * 3 grid. If one player gets three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win. If all nine cells are filled with no winner, it’s a draw. This demo supports local two-player mode only.\nDesign Concept Three Core Elements in the Game Loop Input: Handle mouse left-clicks. If a blank cell is clicked, place a piece.\nData Processing: Check for game-over conditions: three matching pieces in a line or full board. If the game ends, show a popup and exit the loop.\nRendering: Use line() to draw the grid and X pieces (diagonal lines), and circle() for O pieces. Display the current piece type in the top-left corner.\nData Structures Board and Pieces: Use a 2D array char board_data[3][3] for the board. Use 'X' and 'O' for pieces, and '-' for empty cells.\nGame Over Conditions Win: Check all 8 possible winning combinations for both X and O.\nDraw: If no '-' remains and no winner, it’s a draw.\nDevelopment Steps Top-Down Approach Start with the framework, then fill in details.\nGame Loop Skeleton Use bool running to control the loop. Use CheckWin() and CheckDraw() to determine game status.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 bool running = true; ExMessage msg; BeginBatchDraw(); while (running) // Main game loop { while (peekmessage(\u0026amp;msg)) { // Input } // Data processing if (CheckWin(\u0026#39;X\u0026#39;)) { // Pop up message and end the game MessageBox(GetHWnd(), _T(\u0026#34;X Player wins\u0026#34;), _T(\u0026#34;Game over\u0026#34;), MB_OK); running = false; } else if (CheckWin(\u0026#39;O\u0026#39;)) { // Similar logic to the above } else if (CheckDraw()) { // Similar logic to the above } cleardevice(); // Draw all the objects DrawBoard(); DrawPiece(); DrawPrompt(); FlushBatchDraw(); } EndBatchDraw(); Input Logic Mouse coordinates are in pixels. Convert them to grid indices:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 int x = msg.x; // Pixel indices of mouse int y = msg.y; int index_x = x / 200; // Grid indices of mouse int index_y = y / 200; Then place the piece and switch to the other type.\nData Processing Logic CheckWin() uses brute-force to check 8 patterns.\nCheckDraw() loops through all cells to check for '-'.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 for (int col = 0; col \u0026lt; 3; col++) { for (int row = 0; row \u0026lt; 3; row++) { if (board[row][col] == \u0026#39;-\u0026#39;) { } } } Rendering Logic Board: Use line() with pixel coordinates.\nX Pieces: Use diagonal line() calls.\nO Pieces: Use circle() with center offset by +100 pixels.\nDrawing the prompt message: To make it work in more general coding environments, used some less common types and functions \u0026ndash; but they work similarly to C’s printf().\n1 2 static TCHAR str[64]; _stprintf_s(str, _T(\u0026#34;Current piece type：%c\u0026#34;), current_piece); Some font styling functions：\n1 2 settextcolor(RGB(225, 175, 45)); // Set the text color to orange for better visual //\temphasis; outtextxy(0, 0, str); // Display the string at a specified position Optimization Last Piece Not Drawn: If win-check happens before drawing, the popup blocks rendering. So draw first, then check.\nHigh CPU Usage: When a computer runs a while loop, it executes extremely fast—our main game loop can complete thousands of iterations in an instant, consuming a large amount of CPU time. For most displays with a physical refresh rate of only 60Hz, this leads to unnecessary performance waste. A quick and crude solution is to use sleep(15) to force the program to pause for 15 milliseconds after each loop. However, this isn’t recommended. As the game grows in complexity, the amount of computation per loop can vary, depending on how the operating system allocates CPU resources. This means the actual time spent per loop may differ. So instead, we should calculate how long each frame takes to process and dynamically adjust the sleep time afterward. The recommended approach is to set a fixed frame rate manually. To do this, we use the GetTickCount() function, which returns the number of milliseconds since the program started running.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 while (running) { DWORD start_time = GetTickCount(); // Get the start time of the current loop // Read input // Process data // Render screen DWORD end_time = GetTickCount(); // Get the end time of the current loop DWORD delta_time = end_time - start_time; // Calculate the time interval // Dynamically assign sleep time based on the interval // Refresh the screen at 60 frames per second if (delta_time \u0026lt; 1000 / 60) // If the interval is less than the time for one frame, // sleep; Otherwise, no need to sleep { Sleep(1000 / 60 - delta_time); } } // Release resources } Full source code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 #include \u0026lt;graphics.h\u0026gt;

I’ve used C++ and raylib before, but mostly by copying code without fully grasping it. This time, I followed the tutorial step by step, focusing on fast and simple implementation rather than object-oriented design.
